## Author’s Note

## T he brightest star of the Indian industrial world, the surveyor

of a huge industrial empire like the Tata Group, Ratan Tata,
also has a distinctive place in the world industry.

In the current environment, his role and leadership have
been a commendable contribution in making the Tata Group
an important institution not only indigenously but also abroad.

When J.R.D. Tata was given the responsibility of industrial
heritage by Ratan Tata, he had a tough challenge to prove his
competence and industrial understanding. He had to prove
that he became the chairman of the Tata group because of his
ability and talent not because of his links with the Tata family.
The then influential men of the Tata group, looked at Ratan
Tata with suspicion and derision. His critics were also no less
active. But Ratan Tata amazed everyone with his unique talent
in a few years. Under his leadership, the Tata group marked
its strong presence at the international level. Not only this, he
was also awarded the title of ‘Indian Henry Ford’. He was
addressed as the pioneer of India’s road to revolution.
‘Lakhtakiya Nano’ is an outstanding example of his talent,
perseverance and foresight.

It is also noteworthy that all of the yugdrashta pioneers of
this clan from Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the group to Ratan
Tata’s predecessor J.R.D. Tata have had a distinctive role in
establishing, refining and modifying the industrial heritage
which Ratan Tata is looking after today.

The foundations, work environment and norms that these
leaders had established also have a strong place in leading the
Tata Group to its present stage. Therefore, it would be
appropriate to mention here all the shinning stars of the ‘Tata
family’, who worked relentlessly for its operation and
progressive growth. Only then a complete and accurate
assessment of Ratan Tata’s personality and actions is possible.
Keeping this fact in mind, necessary material about them is


presented in the beginning of the book. Hopefully, the book will
prove to be inspiring and beneficial for the readers.

## Family Background

## T he Parsi community is believed to have lived in

Persia (present-day Iran) hundreds of years ago. Their
people gradually spread to all the countries of the
world based on trade and industry. In the same
sequence, the Parsi’s also arrived in India centuries
ago. Despite being spread across many regions of the
world, their number is quite less. They are considered
particularly the worshipers of fire, but they also
worship Sun, Moon, and Air. In the old times, the
Parsi community gave special emphasis on archery,
horse riding, and character-building. Changes in many
areas were inevitable over time. Nevertheless, their
perseverance on the purity of community and
character is more or less still intact. As a community
inclined towards preserving their heritage they do not
encourage marriage outside their own societies, even if
they married in close relationships, so that the purity
of the caste could be preserved. This taboo is still
present to a large extent. Even mentally, Parsi’s are
very strong and their behavior is dignified. Their
performance in knowledge and science and their field
of work is generally good.


Parsi’s have created a special place for themselves in the
Indian society. They have earned the respect they truly
deserve. Parsi’s have played an important role not only in the
industrial world but also in contemporary social activities.
Along with making a significant contribution to the economic
development of the country, they have discharged the national
and social commitments with efficiency and integrity. Despite
having minority status, they have not redeemed it for political-
economic benefit but have focused on creating opportunities for
their growth through hard work and dedication. This is an
important characteristic quality of them.

Navsari is also one of the oldest towns in Gujarat. Centuries
ago, a group of Parsi’s came and settled here. For some time,
the region was also under the influence of Parsi’s, later it was
taken over by the Muslim invaders. At the time of
independence of the country in 1947, this area was under the
princely state of Baroda. Navsari has been the home of a large
class of Parsi’s. Dadabhai Naoroji, who was elected as a
member of the British Parliament during the British rule, was
also born in Navsari.

Navsari was also the residence of Nausherwanji Tata, father
of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Gharana. Jamsetji
Tata’s birthplace is Navsari. Today their residence is preserved
as a memorial.

Jamsetji’s father Nausherwanji belonged to that branch of
the Parsi community, which was involved in hieratic work. His
ancestors had been doing the same work for many generations.
Therefore, they were also counted among the respected classes
of the society. With the changing times, the uneasiness of
change started in all societies. The Tata family of the Parsi
community also could not remain untouched by this.
Nausherwanji was the first man in the Tata family who
instead of sticking to centuries-old tradition and values,
thought of going ahead and doing something new. As a result,
he decided to make business his field of work and means of
livelihood.


The town Navsari was quite backward at that time, so to
fulfill his dream, he found Bombay perfectly suitable and left
Navsari and left for Bombay. He started his work with
business and banking. Although this was a new and unfamiliar
area for him, still he was slowly progressing in this area with
steady steps. As the experience grew, his thinking also got a
new direction and he took a concrete decision for the future
that they have to lead their future generations in this direction
only.

His only son Jamset was in Navsari at that time. To give a
practical form to his dream, he also called him to Bombay, so
that he could be raised properly and with experience in the
proper business environment, he could also get business skills,
which would prove helpful in shaping his future.

## Jamsetji Tata

## T he leading man of the Indian industrial world,

Yugdrashta Jamset Nausherwanji Tata, was born on
March 3, in Navsari in a family of Parsi Priests. He is
called the father of Indian industry. He was the only
son of his father. His childhood was spent in Navsari.
When Jamsetji was 13, his father started an export business
in Bombay. He made his debut in Bombay at the age of 14.
According to Parsi tradition, he was married at the age of 16 to
Hirabai (10 years). Nausherwanji wanted to his son to get
higher education, so at the age of 17, he was admitted to
Elphinstone College. After a few years he completed his college
education as a ‘Green Scholar’ (equivalent to graduation). His
attachment to literature and books continued throughout his
life. After completing his education, his father enrolled him
into his business and started to teach him the technicalities of
operation.

In 1859, his father sent him on a business trip to Hong Kong,
where he worked to open a branch of his family firm and was
busy with other related tasks. He lived there until 1863.

### Debut	in	the	Industrial	Field


At the age of 29, he started a personal trading firm in 1868
with a capital of rupees 2100. Through this, Jamsetji and his
partners got the contract to supply some military equipment
abroad. There was a sufficient amount of profit in this which
inspired him to start his work in the field of textiles. In
partnership with some of his friends, he bought an old oil mill
in Bombay in 1869 and converted it into a textile (cloth
manufacturing) factory. He took up the task of managing it
himself and within few years he changed it into a working
factory. Two years later he sold it to a textile businessman at
profit. He named it ‘Alexandra Cotton Mill’.

In 1872, Jamasetji once again turned towards England. This
time his aim was to study the industry there, especially the
textile business in Lancashire. He was keen to develop the
Indian textile industry.

At that time there was about a dozen textile mills in Bombay
and it was considered a suitable place for textile mills. But
contrary to this thinking, Jamsetji chose Nagpur, in central
India to set up his factory. Thus, they also got the benefit of the
railway facilities established up to that area at that time.
While choosing Nagpur city, he kept in mind three main facts -
cotton production, railway facilities and fuel and water supply
situation.

In 1874, he started ‘The Central Indian Spinning, Weaving
And Manufacturing Company’ with a capital of 15,00,
investing capital along with his friends. After declaring Queen
Victoria as Queen of India on 1 January,1877, the ‘Empires
Mill’ was started in Nagpur.

The yarn cloth mill of Nagpur also worked as laboratory for
Jamsetji. Here he focused on every single details of its
development. Special focus was given on new experiments of
technology and labour welfare. Quality of the fabric was also
improved by substituting the most advanced American
machinery of that time. He made new facilities like the pension
fund in the year 1886 and accident compensation in the year
1895 for his workers. In this way he surpassed his competitors.


Encouraged by his primary successes, in 1886 only he
thought of purchasing a defamed ailing mill. At the age of 47
he accepted the challenge of turning this sick mill into a
healthy one. This mill, named ‘Swadeshi Cotton Mill’ on the
lines of Swadeshi movement, was mainly supported by Indian
share-holders. He invested in it willingly. But later on, some
situations were such that even after two years the mill could
not declare dividend. Due to some reasons and rumours, prices
of the share fell. The name of ‘Tata’ was at stake. When the
banks also refused to give loans Jamsetji collected capital by
selling some share of his Family Trust and Empires Mill and
invested it in the indigenous cotton mill. This had a desired
effect and the stock prices went up. He provided the best
services of his best minds and skilled employees to the
Swadeshi Cotton Mill and within a few years transformed it
into a high-grade textile mill. Soon the fabric manufactured in
it started to get exported to China, Korea, Japan and Middle
East countries.

When Jamsetji realized that bulk of company’s profit was
spent in paying the freight for water transportation of goods
from Bombay to China and Japan branches he took the
initiative to change the situation. At that time, this waterway
was predominantly monopolized by three companies, which
always kept their rates high. So Jamsetji turned to a Japanese
steam navigation company called ‘Nippon Yusen Kaisha’ to
facilitate cheap transportation. Monopoly companies opposed
this, but Jamsetji fought it out and emerged victorious. In June
1896, these companies were forced to reduce their freight to a
reasonable and competitive level.

Jamsetji was fully aware that the industrial revolution is a
fundamental requirement for industrial success, so he was
determined to use the advanced technology and methods
prevalent in the industrial sector. At that time, the work of
increasing the network of railways and telegraph to connect
different regions of India was going on. The Tata group made
meaningful use of it in expanding its industrial empire.

### Entry	into	Iron	and	Steel	Industry


During his stay in England itself Jamsetji had decided that
he would definitely establish an Iron and Steel industry in
India. In view of the circumstances of that time this thought
was itself a brave work. India’s then British government was
also not interested in developing big businesses in India.
Therefore, the policies of the government were automatically a
road block. But Jamsetji was unstoppable to embody his
imagination.

In 1901, Jamsetji focused on the Indian steel industry which
was at its primary stage at that time and produced a small
amount of steel. In this work he took help of British and
American surveyors. The main name among them is that of an
American Charles Page Perin, who spent many years in India
for the Geological Survey of India to find iron deposits. Later
on, a few Indian surveyors also supported him. He travelled to
European countries and America for technical advice and
information of steel making. He wanted to undertake iron
refining on a large scale so he invested a large amount of
money on this project. Before this plan of Jamsetji could take
shape, he died in Germany in 1904. He had two sons to
decorate, cherish, develop and fulfil his incomplete dreams,
elder son Dorabji and the younger son Ratan and to support
both of them Jamsetji’s cousin R.D. Tata was present. Before
he died, he had expressed his wish to his cousin R.D. Tata, son
Dorab and other close relatives to carry forward the work he
had started. If they could not do so then at least should
preserve to continue the work done so far.

Jamsetji’s dream of steel making came true when the Tata
Steel and Iron Company was established in 1907 at Sakchi,
150 miles west of Calcutta. This place was suitable for raw
materials, coal, water supply and transportation, so the
company grew rapidly. On 16 February 1912, the first steel
ingot was produced from the Sakchi plant in a happy
atmosphere. Today it is a major steel industry in the country.
The imagination Jamsetji had for his steel city was given full
respect in the making of Jamshedpur (Sakchi).

### Construction	of	Taj	Mahal	Hotel


Jamsetji built India’s best hotel the Taj Mahal Hotel in
Bombay. A huge amount of money was spent in its
construction. His purpose behind its construction was to
promote tourism by attracting travellers to India. He himself
bought the furnishings of the hotel during his travels. The
hotel was well equipped with all the facilities in line with
European standards of that time. In this, all necessary
arrangements were made, including a soda and ice factory,
washing and polishing machines, laundry, elevators and
electric generators. It was inaugurated in 1903. At that time, it
was the first building in Bombay which was lighted. It had
American fans and Turkey styled bathrooms. English butlers
were appointed for the kitchen. Overall, the hotel had all the
facilities that were present in the world’s best-known hotels.

### Jamsetji’s	Public	Welfare	Works

Jamshetji was deeply connected with the rites of benevolence.
For this, in 1892, he established the J.N. Tata Trust. He
established a fund for higher education. Under this, he started
sending deserving students abroad for higher education. Under
this scheme, many of India’s early engineers, surgeons,
physician, barristers and ICS officers were benefited.

In 1898, he presented his fourteen buildings and a large sum
of money and four properties for the establishment of the Post
Graduate Institute for Scientific Research. Although his dream
could not be fulfilled during his life time due to the high-
handedness of the British Government, but his sons fulfilled it
after his death. Thus in 1911, the institute was established in
Bangalore, which was a joint collaboration of Tata,
Government of India and Government of Mysore. Initially it
had only three major departments — General and Applied
Chemistry, Electro Technology Chemistry and Organic
Chemistry. Later, many other departments were added to it
from time to time.

Like Tata Steel, Jamshedpur, the Indian Institute, Bangalore
served as a centre from which later many other branches—
Central Food and Technological Research Institute, Mysore;
Lac Research Institute, Ranchi; National Aeronautical


Laboratory, Bangalore bloomed. It also contributed to the
establishment and development of many other institutions.

### Endowed	with	Vision	and	Intuition

Jamsetji will also be remembered for his vision, intuition and
for imbibing and implementing new ideas and fantasies. He
used it not only to develop his business but also to improve the
lives of the countrymen. He gave importance to innovation. He
was the first person to use rubber tires in the wagon. He was
the first automobile driver in Bombay. He donated generously
for essential works. He was steeped in high social ideals. He
made new arrangements for labour facilities and their welfare
in the field of labour and introduced new rules, which would
not have been in the imagination of anyone else. Those reforms
were implemented abroad after many decades. Many reforms
came into existence only after many movements. The whole
country still respects him and remembers him with gratitude.

On January 7, 1965, the Indian Postal and Telegraph
Department commenced a postage stamp in honour of
Jamsetji. It shows the gratitude of the country for his services
in industrialization of the country.

## Sir Dorabji Tata

## D orabji was the elder son of Jamsetji Tata, who, after

his death, took care of his legacy and took it to new
heights. His younger brother Sir Ratan Tata and
Jamsetji’s cousin Ratan Dadabhai Tata gave full
support in this task. It was his optimism and strong
will power that helped the Tata Group overcome every
difficulty and he managed to take the company to new
heights by giving form to his father’s dreams.
Dorabji was born in 1859 and got his primary education at
the Proprietary High School in Bombay. He was then sent to
England. At the age of 18, he attended Gonville and Caius
College in Cambridge. He also performed well in sports while
studying at Cambridge and won several awards in cricket and
football. Dorabji returned to India in 1879 and enrolled at St.
Xavier’s College, Bombay. After completion of his education, he
started his work as a journalist at the ‘Bombay Gazette’.
Gradually he became interested in his father’s business and in
1884 he entered the ancestral business. He was accommodated
in the cotton division.

Jamsetji wanted his son Dorab to meet the high scholar and
respected Dr. H.J. Bhabha, who lived with his daughter


Meherbai. When he reached there, he also met Bhabha’s
daughter Meher. This meeting later ended into their marriage.
At the time of this marriage in 1897, Dorabji was 38 years old,
while Meherbai was only 18 years old.

Dorabji had all the qualities of the Tata family for which they
were well-known. These qualities are - leading, leadership and
achievement of purpose. It was the result of his thinking and
foresight that he fulfilled all the dreams of his father, which
Jamsetji could not fulfill during his life. With the help of his
close relative R.D. Tata, he first focused on the projects his
father had started. The first of these was the establishment of
a modern iron and steel industry — the result of which is Tata
Steel.

Along with that, with his increased morale he set up ‘Tata
Power’ to supply electricity to the industries. These two are
integral parts of the ‘Tata Industry Group’ today.

He served as a driving force for each member of his team.
Whatever project he took up, he kept himself completely
attached to it. He kept a close watch on every detail. He even
travelled to mineral fields with scientists and explorers
engaged in the discovery of cast iron.

The Tata group expanded significantly under the leadership
of Dorabji. It expanded rapidly and diversified beyond
Jamsetji’s era to just three textile factories and the Taj Hotel.
In addition to the largest steel company in the personal sector
it soon managed and owned an integrated steel plant, three
hydroelectric power companies, a large edible oil and soap
factory, two cement factories. Apart from these, Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore was established during the
tenure of Dorabji. In 1910, the King of England conferred him
with the title of Knighthood (Sir). In this way he was
appreciated and honoured for his works.

Dorabji had a great interest in sports. This attachment
towards sports was further enhanced when he was studying in
Cambridge. In order to increase interest and improve the level
of sports in India, he started the ‘Olympic Movement’. As the


President of the Indian Olympic Association in 1924, he bore
the expenses of the Indian batch participating in the Paris
Olympics. He was also elected a member of the International
Olympic Association.

## Lady Meherbai

## D orabji’s wife Meherbai has a remarkable place in

the India’s women movement. She was always devoted
towards the education and the welfare of Indian
women. She was the founding member of the ‘Bombay
Presidency Women Council’ and later the ‘National
Council of Women’. She agitated movements for giving
higher education to women, abolition of purdah and
eradication of untouchability. In this work she was
fully supported by Dorabji also. She called a surveyor
from England to conduct a survey of girls’ education in
India. The survey was continued for one year and
came out in form of a book, which served as a pioneer
for women education for the next several years.
Her speech about India and Indians at the Bottle Creek
College, America was very compendious, covering every aspect
of Indian life and society. Like Dorabji, she too was very fond of
sports. She was a good tennis player and won many awards as
well. Together they participated in many All India
Championships and achieved success.

She was also an active member of the Indian Red Cross.
During the war, she also worked hard in raising donations etc.


In recognition of her contribution, King George V honoured her
himself.

She died of leukemia on June 18, 1931. Dorabji established
the ‘Lady Tata Memorial Trust’ in 1932 in her memory. This
trust was formed to study various blood related diseases. In
1932, he established a trust fund, which was to be used for
further work in research, disaster relief and other
humanitarian purposes. The trust was named ‘Sir Dorabji Tata
Trust’ and it is believed that he invested all his assets in this
trust.

Dorabji also contributed greatly in the field of education. He
gave a large amount of money to Cambridge University for a
laboratory equipment. He also helped the ‘Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute’ (Pune) financially to study
Sanskrit.

He died on 3 June 1932 in Germany. His mausoleum remains
near the tomb of his wife Meherbai in Brookwood Cemetery,
England.

## Ratan Dadabhai Tata

## R atan Dadabhai Tata renowned as R.D. Tata was

born in Navsari in 1856. It was here that he got his
primary education. Later he received his higher
education at Elphinstone College and then studied
agricultural science in Madras.
After completing his education, he started his work with his
father’s company Tata & Co. When he started his work, the
company’s condition was not good, the business was heading
towards recession. Hence, he was sent to Hong Kong for
company work.

Even after his father’s death in 1876, he continued to work.
In 1883, he took over the charge of the company. The company
was not in good state at that time. This was the time when he
got an opportunity to demonstrate his financial ability and he
got his company out of many problems and vicious circles.

Jamsetji was very impressed with the caliber of R.D. Tata.
Therefore, in 1884, he made him a part of his company
‘Empress Mills’. After this, in 1887, he was incorporated as a
partner in his newly formed company, Tata and Sons.

Ratan Dadabhai was associated with its manager Bejanji
Dadabhai Mehta in the ‘Empress Mills’. Bejanji was then
looking after the technical and management work, while Ratan


Dadabhai was entrusted with the financial side. During the
same period, he was entrusted with the task of opening a
factory in Yavatmal along with his cousin, Dorabji Tata. The
economic condition of the indigenous mill was not good at that
time, hence its financial workload was assigned to R.D. Tata.
Together with Dorabji under the guidance of Jamsetji, he
successfully carried out his work and helped the company in
overcoming difficulties.

The business of the company set up by Jamsetdji was
different from that of Nausherwanji, so he gave the charge of
the eastern branch to his cousin R.D. Tata. R.D. Tata moved to
Hong Kong for a few years, where he set up branches in places
like Shanghai, which ran the rice and silk business. This
business flourished so much under his control that soon new
branches opened in New York and Paris, which mainly traded
in pearls and silk. It was in Paris that he fell in love with
Suzanne Briere and in 1902 he married her.

After the death of Jamsetji, in 1907, the name of ‘Tata and
Sons’ was changed to ‘Tata Sons and Company’. It had three
partners — Sir Dorabji, Sir Ratan Tata and R.D. Tata. The
company operating from Hong Kong under the name of Tata &
Co. was also merged with this new company.

R. D. Tata’s main work was to look after business and
financial work while staying in the Bombay headquarters.
While staying here he played an important role in completing
the projects - Iron and Steel Company, Hydroelectric Company
and Indian Institute of Science, envisaged by Jamsetji. After
the death of Sir Ratan Tata in 1918, R.D. Tata took over the
important departments of the company. During the first world
war when the company was going through a period of
hardship, it was the work efficiency of R.D.Tata that helped
the company overcome such a difficult time. This was possible
only because of his mature experience and unparalleled
guidance.

Despite serious economic difficulties, he was always devoted
to welfare works and humanity.


He was also a member of the ‘Imperial Legislative Council’
for some time which later helped him in assuring the rescue of
the iron and steel industry.

His visit to Japan in 1890 helped develop the India-Japan
trade relationship. The Japanese emperor recognized his work
and conferred him with the title ‘Third Order of Rising Sun’.
He departed for his heavenly abode on August 26, 1926.

## Sir Ratan Tata

## J amsetji’s younger son Sir Ratan Tata was born on

January 20, 1871. He was 12 years younger than his
brother Dorabji. He completed his education from St.
Xavier’s College, Bombay. He got married to Nawazbai
in 1892.
After marriage, Ratan started living in Esplanade House
with his parents and wife. After the death of his father
Jamsetji, he made Brightland his place of residence in the
Marine Line. He later built a magnificent building for himself
on Wodby Road, which was completed in 1915. He was able to
stay in this building only for a few months, after which he went
to England for his treatment and then took his last breath
there only.

After the death of his father Jamsetji, started working in a
French insurance company, whose agent in India was ‘Tata
and Sons’. He also handled the work of ‘Tata and Company’,
which did business of textiles, yarn, silk, pearls and rice etc. It
had branches in Paris, Shanghai, Kobe, New York and
Rangoon.

Although Sir Ratan Tata was associated with the functioning
of ‘Tata and Sons’, most of its responsibility was on his elder
brother Dorabji. Ratan took special interest in land acquisition


in Mahim and Bandra and later the government took up this
task.

Sir Ratan Tata was socially very active. He had keen interest
in travelling as well. In the latter part of his life, every year he
used to spent much of his time in England. He was a member
of the ‘Carlton Club’, London and was considered a respected
member of the High Society of England. In 1906, he bought
‘York House’ in Twickenham, near London, England, and
developed a beautiful garden in an area of 12 acres adjacent to
it.

## Social consciousness was also was one his

## qualities. He was fully aware of the

## importance of the struggle done under the

## leadership of Mahatma Gandhi against the

## excesses of the British in South Africa.

## Therefore, he not only gave it moral support

## but helped in financial terms as well. As a

## contribution to this struggle, he sent `

## 1,25,000 to Gandhiji in five instalments. On

## the other hand, he gave adequate support

## and cooperation to the excellent work being

## done by Gopal Krishna Gokhale and his

## ‘Servants of India Society’ in the country. He

## also gave a total financial assistance of

## rupees 1,10,000 to this movement under his

## generous support.

Sir Ratan was very much agitated after seeing the poverty
and plight of India and its people and he wanted to improve it.
He urged that this matter should be investigated in a scientific


manner. In 1912, he proposed financial assistance to the
University of London to set up a body to work in this direction,
so that suggestions could be made for identifying and
diagnosing the causes of poverty and poor conditions. It was
formed in 1913 and Sir Ratan accepted to give aid for three
years at the rate of 1,400 pounds per year. In 1916, it was
extended for five years. Even after his death this payment was
made by his trustees till 1931. Many candidates did their
research in this area and presented papers as well.

Sir Ratan Tata also provided economic assistance to the
London School of Economics to open its department for the
study of ‘Social Sciences’. This new department was called
‘Ratan Tata Department of Social Sciences’ in 1919. Later
‘London School of Economics’ took its complete charge and
accordingly its name was also changed.

Sir Ratan Tata was also very interested in India’s past. In
1912, he proposed to provide economic assistance for
archaeological survey and excavation in Bihar and Odisha.
Accordingly, extensive excavation in Pataliputra, was done
under the supervision of Dr. A.B. Spooner. From 1913 to 1917,
Sir Ratan Tata provided assistance of 75,000 rupees for this
work. Many coins, terracotta items and other valuable
materials were found in this excavation, which are still
preserved in the Patna Museum.

Sir Ratan Tata was very kind hearted. He gave donations for
any such work, which affected him. He contributed greatly for
relief in the event of natural calamities like flood, famine or
earthquake. Apart from this, he also provided financial
assistance to public monuments, schools and hospitals. He
financed 10,000 rupees per year for ten years to the ‘George V
Anti Tuberculosis League’. The institute operated by this
institution used to treat poor patients of tuberculosis. In 1916,
he was awarded the title of Knighthood (Sir) for his various
service works.

He was also a great admirer of art. During his travels both at
home and abroad, he used to collect photographs, oil paintings,
guns, swords, silverware, manuscripts, characters and carpets,


which were important in terms of art and education. Later he
handed over the collection to the Prince of Wales Museum,
Bombay.

In 1916, Sir Ratan visited China and Japan. He fell ill after
his return. The doctors advised him to go to England for
treatment. He left for England in October 1916 with his wife
Nawazbai and Secretary P.P. Mistry. On the way, their ship
fell victim to the torpedoes of the Germans. Although Ratanji
was rescued along with all the other passengers, this delay on
the way had an adverse effect on his health.

He died in September 1918 in St Abbs, Carnival. His
mausoleum is in Brookwood Cemetery, London near to his
father’s mausoleum.

Sir Ratan Tata had no child. In his will, he devoted a
considerable part of his wealth to philanthropic works.

## Lady Nawazbai

## N awazbai, the wife of Sir Ratan, was born in

```
September 1877. She was married to Sir Ratan in
```
1890. She was proficient in horse riding and polo.
They had spent a part of their lives in London and the
couple was highly respected among the elite people.
Like Sir Ratan Tata, Lady Nawazbai was also a great
admirer of fine art. Her contribution in the collection
of various artifacts cannot be underestimated.
Nawazbai was widowed at the age of 41. She had a
great responsibility to take care of the estate of Sir
Ratan. She spent the rest of her life in a dignified way
in the ‘Tata House’.
After the untimely death of Sir Ratan, Nawazbai was
inducted into the governing board of ‘Tata Sons’ in 1918. She
held this position till her death. She died in August 1965. She
was the first and only woman to be a member of the governing
board of ‘Tata Sons’. A generous donation to the ‘National
Metallurgical Research Institute’ in Jamshedpur exemplifies
her immense heart. By this, she demonstrated her willingness
to spend the fund of Sir Ratan Tata Trust in creative work.


In 1928, she played a major role in the establishment of
‘Ratan Tata Institute’. Through this, instead of giving cash
assistance to the people, it worked towards providing necessary
training and employment opportunities to the poor and needy
people in individual institutions. She wished for the welfare of
all. She was above the spirit of religion, sect and caste,
therefore was ready to help everyone.

As Chairperson of the ‘Sir Ratan Tata Trust’, she invited
S.J.I. Markham of the Carnage Trust to study the problems of
the Parsi community and present a report on it. With this
move, Parsi Charities organized themselves to make their
‘charity’ capable.

Childless Nawazbai wished for the survival of her husband’s
legacy, so she adopted Naval Hormusji Tata, son of Hormusji
Tata. In this way, this adopted son of Lady Nawazbai later
took over the work of the Tata family.

```

## Naval Hormusji Tata

## N aval Hormusji Tata was born on 30 August, 1904 in

Bombay to a middle-class family.
His father Hormusji Tata was a spinning master in a mill in
Ahmedabad. His father died when he was just four years old.
This was a great shock to his family. It was a difficult task for
their widowed mother to raise her growing children. His
relatives in Bombay brought them some relief. After that, their
family house in Navsari became their shelter.

Eventually the family settled in Surat. Their necessary
expenses started to be met from the income of Zardozi work
being done by their mother.

Meanwhile, Dorabji arrived on the scene. With his help, two
of Naval’s brothers got shelter in the J.N. Petit Parsi
orphanage. There were about 300 children in this orphanage,
for whom a limited amount of money was available in the form
of budget for food, clothes and health. It was more or less a
difficult life.

Staying in this position, this child later went on to reach an
important position at the Tata Institute. It was a unique blend


of his determination and personal qualities that brought him to
this milestone of success.

As it is well known that Jamsetji Tata was married to
Heerabai. He had two sons - Dorabji and Ratanji, who had no
heir. When he was growing up in an orphanage, he was
adopted by Sir Ratan Tata’s wife, Lady Nawazbai.

Sir Ratan Tata died in England in 1918 at the age of 47. At a
meeting of family members chaired by Sir Dorabji, it was
decided that a son is must for ‘Utthama Sanskar’, so one
should be adopted as a son. Naval’s mother was Sir Ratan’s
favourite cousin, so it was decided to adopt Naval. Nawazbai
accepted this family decision and thus Naval Hormusji Tata
was adopted. Nawazbai immediately wanted to take Naval out
of the orphanage, but the rules of the orphanage came in the
way. He was able to leave from there only when he passed his
tenth examination while living there.

Although he suddenly became a member of an influential
family in the country, but he never forgot his past. He used to
say that I am thankful to God, who gave me the opportunity to
experience the sufferings of poverty, which moulded my
personality accordingly in the years to come.

After completing his Bachelor’s in Economics from Bombay
University, he went to England to complete a short course in
accountancy. After returning from there in 1930, he entered
the Tata organization as Dispatch Clerk Assistant Secretary.

He soon joined the post of Assistant Secretary at Tata Sons.
In 1933, he was made Secretary in the Department of
Aeronautics. He was later transferred to the textile
department as an executive. Seeing his abilities, he was made
Joint Managing Director of the textile factories operated by
Tata in 1939. In 1941, he was promoted as a director in Tata
Sons. In 1948, he took over as the managing director of Tata
Oil Mills Company Limited. Prior to this, he had already
become the chairman of Tata Mills. In the following years he
was promoted swiftly. He was made the chairman of other


textile factories and three electric companies and later was
appointed vice-president at Tata Sons.

In this way, he had the direct responsibility of managing four
textile mills, three power companies and the Sir Ratan Tata
Trust. Apart from this, he was also responsible for guiding
several other companies and trusts of the group.

Despite being surrounded by work engagements, he
maintained his calm nature, goodwill and humility like
qualities in his personality and never forgot his past.

Despite his busy schedule at Bombay House, he used to meet
people of all sections of society. He was very fond of various
trusts operated under the name Tata; because the work of
these trusts was based on a spirit of philanthropy. Therefore,
he felt a personal liability towards these works.

He was the President of the Indian Cancer Society for nearly
30 years. He also contributed greatly in the field of sports. He
was also the President of the ‘Indian Hockey Federation’ from
1946 to 1961. He was the first chairman of the ‘All India
Council for Sports’. He also provided services to the
‘International Hockey Federation’.

Despite a tiring lifestyle of the day, he kept himself fresh and
was humorous as well. He was a very social and simple man.
The employees also enjoyed his interesting jokes and respected
him.

His work on labour relations was also much better than
predecessors. He was an honest and open person. He had a
keen interest in solving the problems of the working class.
According to the situations, he used to put forward his views
and considered all options adequately to solve a problem.

In 1946, he represented the Indian textile industry in the
International Labour Union. His ideas were highly
appreciated. In 1957, he was elected a member of the
Regulatory Committee of the International Trade Union and
remained its member until his death in 1989. In 1966, he was
elected as a member of the ‘Labour Panel’ of the Planning
Commission in the country.


‘The National Institute of Labour Management’ was
established by him, which is today known as the ‘National
Institute of Personal Management’. He was also its president
from 1951 to 1980. He worked to bridge the growing gap
between the owners and employees due to various reasons. He
suggested fair and appropriate measures. He considered
himself an advocate of employee interests and did continuous
and remarkable work for their rights and interests. He also
took full care of the interests of the employees of the
unorganized sector.

He was the President of the Indian Hockey Federation for
many years. During his presidential tenure, India won three
consecutive Olympic gold medals in Olympic hockey. Tata
Sports Club played an important role in serving the Indian
hockey.

He was rich in an all-round talent. Many times, he was
offering his services to several institutions simultaneously,
such as Indian Institute of Science, Swadeshi League, Bombay
State Social Welfare Council, National Safety Council etc. He
was also the chairman of several public welfare trusts.

On Republic Day in 1969, the President honoured him with
‘Padma Vibhushan’. In the same year he was honoured for his
contribution to maintaining industrial peace.

Naval Hormusji Tata was married to Sunu. His household
life was not pleasant. After the divorce of Naval and Sunu,
Lady Nawazbai took over the responsibility of raising their
sons Ratan and Jimmy.

On 5 May 1989, Naval Hormusji, of a simple heart and
reformative tendency passed away. He was in favour of giving
everyone equal opportunities for progress.

## J.R.D.	Tata

## J ahangir Ratan Dadabhai (J.R.D.) was born on July

29, 1904 in Paris. His mother was French. His father’s
name was Ratan Dadabhai Tata. He was known
among people as Jamsetji’s cousin and R.D. He did his
education in France, Japan and other countries. He
also served primary service in the French army for one
year. He wished to remain in the army, but God had
planned something else for him. So he had to say
goodbye to the French army. He wanted to pursue
engineering education from Cambridge University, but
in the meantime, he received a message from his
father to return to India and complied as an obedient
son. Returning here, he found himself in an
environment and business empire that he was not
used to. His work started as an assistant at Tata Sons.
Shortly after his father’s death he was inducted as a
director in the company in 1926. He was appointed
chairman in 1938. J.R.D. was a charismatic person.
He contributed to the industrial development of India for
almost 53 years. On 25 March 1991, he handed over the charge
of Tata Sons to his junior partner Ratan Naval Tata. The board


of Tata Sons unanimously elected him as its lifetime chairman
(retired).

J.R.D. is considered the founder of civil aviation in India. He
was the first pilot in India to achieve this qualification. In
1932, he founded India’s first national carrier, Tata Airlines. In
1946, it was renamed as ‘Air India Limited’. The inaugural
flight of Tata Airlines travelled between Karachi to Bombay
and was operated by J.R.D. himself. In the following years, he
established Air India International Ltd. as a joint venture with
the Government of India for long-haul international flights. He
was its executive chairman until its nationalization in 1953.

On his suggestion, the Government of India set up two flying
corporations—Air India and Indian Airlines, which were
formed for international and domestic flights respectively. He
was appointed the chairman of Air India. He continued
working in this post till 1978.

At the age of 78, on the fiftieth anniversary of Indian Civil
Aviation, he repeated his 1932 inaugural flight in a 50-year-old
aircraft on 15 October 1982.

He was awarded several awards for his contribution to the
aeronautical field. In 1948, he was awarded the rank of
Honorary Group Captain in the Indian Air Force and in 1966
as Air Commodore (Honorary). Apart from this, he also
received many international awards.

He took care of Tata Airlines like a child. He had worked
hard in its imagery, from the outline to putting it on the
practical plane and later in its development and care. This was
the reason that he strongly opposed the nationalization of Air
India by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1953. Nehru gave him the
leeway to take control and management of the cargo planes,
from where he was separated in 1977 by a law.

Operations of Air India were an example of J.R.D.’s excellent
efficiency. The principles of socialism were then highly
prevalent. Industries had to work under a variety of rules and
restrictions, yet J.R.D. tried his best to lead the country on the
path of industrial upliftment.


It is also clear from this that when J.R.D. took over the
position of chairman of Tata Sons, then the Tata group had 14
companies under its control. In his nearly 50-year tenure, that
is, until July 1988, there were 95 companies that were started
or controlled by the Tata group. Under his mature leadership,
the Tata group expanded in all directions. Prominent among
them are electricity, engineering, hotels, consultancy services,
information technology, consumer goods and other industrial
products.

His contribution in the field of science and medicine is also
unique. During his tenure, Tata Institute of Social Science,
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, National Institute of
Advanced Sciences, Tata Memorial Hospital touched new
heights in their respective fields.

J.R.D. gave a new direction to the current business practices
at that time. Instead of adopting the practice of running an
enterprise under the supervision of members of the households,
they adopted a purely commercial approach. Bringing the
talent forward, harnessing their skills and giving them an
opportunity to grow. Some difficulties also came into his way,
but he faced those challenges.

For J.R.D., the aim of national interest lied in the progress of
the country and he made his full contribution in thus direction.
The idea of donating at the simple level and having a sense of
fulfilment of his duty was not acceptable to him, rather, he
gave priority to such works which were sustainable and gave
permanent results. Keeping this in mind, the multi-purpose
‘Tata Trust’ was established in 1944. J.R.D. established the
‘Thelma Tata Trust’ in Bombay with the proceeds from the sale
of his shares. The aim of this trust was to improve the status of
women of disadvantaged sections and to lead them towards
progress.

He was an advocate of family planning and population control
in the interest of the country. In recognition of his efforts, he
was awarded the U.N. Population Award in September 1992.
He was the founding member of ‘Family Planning Institute’.
He was also the Chairman of the Governing Body of the Tata


Institute of Fundamental Research, Member of the Atomic
Energy Commission, President of the Court of Indian Institute
of Science, Bangalore. He served as chairman of the ‘J.N. Tata
Endowment for the Higher Education of Indians’ and ‘Homi
Bhabha Fellowship Council.’ Along with this, he handled the
post of chairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, J.RD. Tata
Trust and Jamsetji Trust.

He also received many national and international awards.
Prominent among them were ‘Padma Vibhushan’, ‘Legion of
Honour’ of France, ‘Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of
Germany’ and doctoral degrees from Allahabad, Bombay,
Roorkee and Banaras University etc. The Government of India
honoured him with the ‘Bharat Ratna’, the highest civilian
honour of the country in 1992. He died in Geneva in November
1993.

J.R.D. had met Thelma in France. Their romance with
Thelma resulted in a happy marriage and they got married in

1930. He was childless, but he accepted it as God’s will.
Although, he is not among us but his legacy will always remain
alive. The country will always remember him.

## Ratan Tata

## R atan Naval Tata was born in 1937 in Bombay in the

rich and famous Tata family. He is the son of Sunu
and Naval Hormusji Tata.
Ratan’s childhood was a bit unfortunate as well. When he
was just seven years old, his parents got divorced. Ratan and
his brother Jimmy were raised by their grandmother
Nawazbai. She had great affection for Ratan. Ratan Tata did
his early education at Campion School in Bombay. At the age
of fifteen, he was sent to the United States to pursue further
studies. He received his bachelor’s degree in Architecture and
Structural Engineering in 1962 from Cornell University, USA.
He also did a course in Advanced Management Program from
Harvard Business School.

After coming to India in 1962, he entered the Tata group. At
that time, J.R.D. was the chairman of the Tata group. He sent
Ratan to Jamshedpur to work at Tata Steel, so that he could
understand the work of Tata Steel properly. There he worked
like the other employees only, wearing a blue uniform. It
included all the work from removing the lime stones with the
shovels to work related to the blazing furnaces.


In 1971, he was given the charge of National Radio and
Electronics Company (NELCO). NELCO was going through
economic difficulties at that time. Nobody expected its success.
But looking at the future of Tata Company, Ratan succeeded in
convincing the then chairman J.R.D. that more investment was
needed in the company. Although, J.R.D. was not keen to
invest more in it.

This was the time when the country was under the
dominating influence of license and permit. As a result, he had
to face many difficulties in carrying out his work. These
difficulties gave him a new vision. Therefore, he focused on
further improving his abilities and in 1975 received higher
education in management from Harvard School. In December
1988, he was made the chairman of Telco. After the death of
his father in 1989, he took over the charge of Sir Ratan Tata
Trust as chairman.

During his tenure, J.R.D. Tata broadened the basis of Tata
Sons. As a result, in 1980 where there were only 11 directors,
by 1991 their number increased to 18. It included those people
who played an important role in the development of the Tata
Group. In later years, this kept changing.

On March 25, 1991, J.R.D. Tata proposed Ratan Naval Tata
for the post of Chairman of Tata Sons as his successor and
retired on his own.

## Tata Group’s Journey Under the

## Leadership of	Ratan Tata

## W hen Ratan Tata took over the charge of the 104-

year-old Tata Group, his predecessor, J.R.D. Tata had
handled this work for almost 50 years. He gave the
group a new shine, while on the other hand he also left
an impression of his personal style. In the latter half
of J.R.D.’s tenure, the powerful chairman and
managing directors of various Tata Group institutions,
which were closely associated with J.R.D., tried to
leave their mark on the companies related to them in
the backdrop of the closeness of their relationship.
In July 1991, the central government abolished many
provisions of the M.R.T.P. and moved towards liberalization.
This task of the government was quite a relief for Ratan Tata,
who took charge just three months ago.

When Ratan Tata rose to the position of chairman, the
operations of individual companies were in the hands of
powerful chairmen or managing directors and they were
operating in their own way. The main challenge for him was to


bring them all together. He set the age of retirement for the
post of chairman and managing director. This age was 75 years
for the chairman and 65 years for the managing director. He
organized the erstwhile companies, made sure to come out of
some others, set up new companies and later acquired some.
He made 32 new starts in the first decade of his tenure.

It was clear till the death of J.R.D. (1993), that Ratan Tata’s
attempt to organize the group companies under the banner of
‘Tata Sons’, had the blessing of J.R.D. with him. In this period
of liberalization, the ‘Tata’ holding company gradually
increased its share ratios in group companies such as Tisco
(Tata Steel), Tata Chemicals, Telco (Tata Motors) and Tata
Tea. Under him, Tata Consultancy Services was publicized.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors was listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

In order to facilitate the operations, the Tata group sold its
shares in the last decade of the century in a number of sectors
such as edible oils (TOMCO), cosmetics (Lakme),
pharmaceuticals (Rallis & Merind), paints (Goodlass Nerolac).
In addition, he sold assets in ACC, computer and
telecommunication hardware and oil. They split from joint
ventures like IBM Timex.

Between 1990 and 2002, his main focus was on cars, telecom,
insurance and fertilizers. Today, in the twenty-first century
Tata Group’s scope of work can be mainly divided into the
following seven areas-

(a) **Materials:** such as steel and advanced plastics

(b) **Chemicals:** Inorganic fertilizers, pesticides

(c) **Engineering:** Automobiles, auto components, air
conditioning

(d) **Energy:** Energy

(e) **Consumer goods:** Tea, coffee, watch

(f) **Services:** Hotel, retail, finance services, insurance,
international trade


(g) **Information methods:** Software, industrial & telecom,
automation & telecom

As soon as Ratan Tata took over as the chairman, he laid the
foundation stone for many technology businesses and aimed at
the development of many ventures. Under the efficient
direction of J.R.D., he started giving form to his imaginations
related to the Tata group. It was a transition period. With the
beginning of liberalization, new beliefs and rules were being
replaced in place of old beliefs and systems.

With the change in the central industrial policy, the
government was also trying to remove all the discrepancies in
the establishment of individual undertakings and to create a
suitable environment for their development to some extent. As
a result, some public sector domains were opened up to the
private sector. The economy that was confined and shrunk
under the cloak of socialism for around a decade got the chance
to spread. The economic policies of some countries had changed
and this phase was continuing in many countries. In such a
situation, the Government of India also understood that liberal
policies are needed to achieve good economic growth.

Ratan Tata was also benefited from this new thinking and
situation, as a result he made strides in many new areas of the
industry. It is also worth mentioning here that the Tata
Group’s overseas emoluments grew significantly due to the
‘Tata Consultancy Service’. It was established by Ratan Tata
only in the 80s. Soon it became a well-known name in the
consultancy sector on the world stage.

## Ratan Tata’s Foresight

## W hen Ratan Tata took over the command of Tata Sons, not

only the Tata Group but the entire country was witnessing a
change in the old trends. With the liberalization of the Indian
economy and change in the thinking of the global economy a
new era of opportunities and challenges was unfolded. He took
many steps to meet these challenges and to convert the
available opportunities into success.

To increase holdings in companies managed by Tata: With
this thought, by 2002 the holding in Tata Steel increased from
8 to 26 percent, in Telco from 17 to 32 percent, in Voltas from
22 to 25 percent. In some other companies like Tata Chemicals,
Tata Tea etc. it remained unchanged (30 percent). In some new
companies the holdings were 76 percent in Tata Infotech, 26
percent in Trent Ltd. and 50 percent in Infomedia.

A Group Executive Office was established in the year 1998 as
a part of the operation and consolidation of the Group’s
policies. In this a group chairman and 5 members, who were
from group company, group finance, group human resources
and new group project were included.

Later in 2002, Tata Group Corporate Centre was set up, with
Group Executive Officers as members. It included — Ratan
Tata, Dr. J.J. Irani, R.K. Krishnakumar, M.A. Sunawala, R.
Gopalakrishnan, Ishat Hussain and K.A. Chokar.

A code of conduct was prepared to use the name ‘Tata’. If
anyone disregards it, he had to stop using the name ‘Tata’. The
Tata model of business excellence was launched in 1994.
Seeing the importance of the Tata brand, the Tata companies
were expected to work for the further development of the brand
name.

When Ratan Tata took over, his main challenge at that time
was to bring companies under one framework so that they
could work in one direction. He tightened his grip on
companies. Although, to a larger extent the autonomy of the


company was with him only, but he retained the right to
submit his objection in the event of disagreement as a
shareholder in major policy decisions and to bring it to a
definite outcome.

Today, the Tata Group is not a loose association of different
companies, but a closely connected group, which is headed in
the direction to meet the challenges of the future.

## Strong Intention

# T ata Chemicals and Telco were counted as

## two of the largest companies in India till

## 1980, but an untoward occurred with Telco

## in 2000-01. Overnight, the market for its

## products fell by 45 percent and the company

## incurred a loss of ` 500 crore. In fact, from

## 1993 to 1997, Telco sales had increased by `

## 7,500 crore. The sales fell flat when ` 1,700

## crore was spent on the company’s Indica car

## project. In such a situation, a huge reduction

## in sales and loss of ` 500 crore was a big

## challenge for the company and its

## employees. It was a direct injury to the self-

## respect of the employees and officers. They

## unanimously decided that we have to

## overcome this situation. The fact was that

## only the employees and officers of the

## company could handle this situation well,

## because they knew where and what the

## problem is and what is the solution.

## Ratan Tata, linked this sense of self-esteem

## of the employees successfully to the

## company’s resurgence and made successful


## use of it. And in the third financial year

## itself, i.e. in the year 2002-03, the company

## reached a profit of ` 500 crore (pre-

## condition). This achievement was nothing

## short of a miracle under the erstwhile

## circumstances.

He gave a new edge to the company in the difficult situation.
A task force was formed at a higher level. In no time, forty
action teams were formed, with 230 operation managers
working on the allocated work. All these teams were from Tata
Motors and Consultant sources. These teams worked day and
night, made the data available to the concerned departments
and after that the suitability was examined from the
operational point of view. The deficiencies were determined
and work started accordingly.

The senior manager team met with many young employees
and high-level executors from the chairman to the senior
officials and got their views, took suggestions from them about
the problems and appropriate steps were taken accordingly.

The second task was the use of special training programs and
inspirational steps. For this, mixed groups of employees of all
grades and management personnel of all levels were sent to
workshops for training and motivation. The focus of higher
leadership was to create a result-oriented work culture devoid
of all kinds of shortages. It was this work culture that made
impossible goals possible.

Tata Indica has been Ratan Tata’s dream since 1993, which
came true in 1999. Telco officials toured around the world to
fulfill this dream. Actually, he wanted a car that suited the
Indian situation. It should have the same space like the
ambassador, Zen-like exterior design, Italian style and the
French engine design. Ratan Tata had a mental connect with
this project. So when he accepted the challenge, he worked
hard for the success in that proportion only. When it became


necessary, he received expertise from all the possible sources.
But developed it on its own. Hence, it was truly a national
achievement.

As a result, when Indica came out of the showroom in 1999,
the company had 1,15,000 bookings in which the entire amount
was paid in advance. From this only its fame can be guessed.
Later on, many improvements were made and many other
models like Indica V2, Indigo, Indica Sedan etc. were
developed.

Rovers in England needed a world class car in the same
segment. Hence, it tied up with Telco to sell the Indica V2 in
England and the European continent, and in five years a total
of 100,000 cars were to be sold as City Rover. Its first batch
was sent in 2003.

Tata Chemical was a leading company in its field in the pre-
liberalization era of India. In 1990 it made three new
beginnings. They were — Babrala Fertilizer Plant in Uttar
Pradesh, the establishment of Tata Kisan Kendra and
production of branded edible salt. Out of these, Babrala plant
was started in 1994. Urea was to be produced in it. Along with
this, an ammonia plant was also established in the same
complex. Babrala Complex had set new records in the fields of
production, technology, energy conservation and safety.

Despite this, in the year 1999, an odd situation arose due to
heavy arrival of soda ash from China and reduction in fixed
rate of urea. For the first time in the company’s history, it had
to declare a loss for the quarter that ended in June 2000.

## As a result, a new management committee

## was formed. Working under Prasad Menon,

## the committee had to earn the company

## from afresh by refocusing the factors

## responsible for company’s position. It took

## some important steps of different nature.


## These steps had the desired effect and in

## 2001-02 the amount of profit reached ` 200

## crore.

It was Ratan Tata’s foresight that helped to take all the
necessary steps to deal with an imminent threat, and Tata
Chemicals not only returned to its track but also started to
gallop.

Tata Steel was in strict need of renewal to remain in
competition during the period of liberalization and this
renovation required retrenchment of about 35,000 employees.
At that time, both the factories and mines of Tata Steel had a
total of 78,000 employees. Everyone was aware of its
immediate consequences of sorting on such a large scale, but
sorting was equally necessary. After the estimation of profit
and loss was made under Ratan Tata’s leadership, it was
concluded that this problem can be solved easily if some
attractive conditions are laid down for retrenchment of
employees. The adverse effects from these conditions will be
eliminated within a few years of modernization and eventually
it is a profitable deal. The conditions for voluntary leave were
so attractive that a large number of employees applied for
voluntary leave and soon the company got rid of the additional
employees. All this was achieved by maintaining great ease
and industrial harmony. This is the reason why Tata Steel not
only remained in competition in the coming years but also
surpassed miles. Not only this, it was also able to acquire
heavily competitive steel companies.

His strong intentions are also reflected in the Singur land
acquisition dispute case, where he preferred to move away
instead of succumbing to some people’s stubbornness.

## Some famous Tata Owned Companies and

## Brands

## T ata Group is India’s largest business group in terms of

market order and revenue. Established as a multinational
company, headquarters of this group is in Mumbai. It is
recognized as a respected group all over the world. Its main

## Tata Steel

## F ounded on the belief of Tata, Tata Steel is the first

steel plant not only in India but also in Asia. Tata
Steel has created a new history by acquiring the
Anglo-Dutch steel company Corus. This is the largest
acquisition by an Indian company abroad and is in
keeping with Tata Steel’s reputation.
Jamsetji struggled hard to establish a steel plant, but he died
three years before the site was sought. Before his death, he
made sure that his dream came true. Members of the team
that fulfilled his dream were- his son Dorabji Tata, expert
surveyor C.M. Weld and Shapurji Saklatwala and Charles
Page Perrin, Consulting Engineers, and Jamsetji himself went
to New York to invite them.

Perrin prepared a detailed project report of the company’s
plant. Even after submitting the report, Charles Perrin stayed
in India until the decision to establish the plant at Sakchi was
made. Sakchi’s name was later changed to Jamshedpur and
this conversion of name was done by Lord Chelmsford, the then
Viceroy of India. Only then the Kalimati station got the name
‘Tata Nagar’.

In those days, the spirit of Swadeshi was in spate. Based on
this sentiment, Tata Iron and Steel Company turned towards
the Indian capital market and on August 26, 1907, issued
shares for sale.

Investment letters were received from 8,000 Indian investors
in just three weeks. The Maharaja of Gwalior purchased the
entire 40,000-pound debenture issued for the availability of


working capital. 2.32 crore was raised by issuing common,
primary and deferred shares, through which a steel plant of
72,000 tonnes annual production capacity was to be set up.
Installation of the plant started in 1908 and the first body was
produced in February 1912. Tata had 11 percent stake in this
company.

More than once, it was threatened with its takeover by the
government. To prevent this possibility, a bill was introduced
in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1924. This idea was
fueled for the second time during the Janata Party rule (1977–
79) in 1977 by the then Minister of Industry, but nothing
happened.

Jamsetji dreamed of doing something by setting up Tata
Steel. Tata Steel’s dream was fulfilled Dorabji and J.R.D. Tata.
But J.R.D. Tata was the person who increased Tata’s assets
from 62 crore to 10,000 crore in 1990. J.R.D. had the natural
talent of testing man and developing leadership. He went on to
help an outstanding manager like Russi Mody to excel and
later rose him to a prestigious position. Mody improved the
marketing operations and formed the Export Cell. He founded
the ‘G Blast Furnace’, which according to the 2004 national
record was the largest ‘blast furnace’ of Tata Steel.

J.R.D. Tata’s successor Ratan Tata took over the charge of
the steel company from Russi Mody in 1992. The company’s
competition was mainly about prices due to the liberalized
Indian economy. Therefore, Tata Steel was not in good
condition at that time. McKinsey report in the late 1990s
advised Tata Steel to opt out of the steel business. But the real
scene proved to be an eye opener. Successional changes were
made in the company. Through advanced and attractive
schemes, the company got rid of the excess of employees and
the number of employees decreased from 78,000 to 43,000. This
goal was achieved without harming the industrial harmony.
The company distanced itself from many non-core businesses.
The main thrust was to maintain the quality of steel as well as
cost reduction and to bring prices to competitive levels using
advanced technology. Meanwhile, a cold rolling mill was


established. In 2001, B. Muthuraman replaced J.J. Irani as
Managing Director of the company. Despite steep fluctuations
in steel prices in 2001-02, Tata Steel was among the five steel
companies in the world that made a profit. In the subsequent
years, significant success was recorded through branded
products and retail.

The company made several acquisitions over the past few
years. Among these, the acquisition of Corus Steel is a historic
event.

The company, which was earlier ranked 56th in steel
production, has become the sixth largest steel producer in the
world on its 100th year, it also grew significantly in the
following years.

## Tata Chemicals

## T ata Chemicals was established in 1939. Its first

consignment of imported turbo generators from a
foreign manufacturer were ruined due to the ongoing
World War II and sank into the sea. After this, its next
shipment somehow reached Bombay. But the
company’s early years were not good. The company
had to face many difficulties from installation to
production. Its most profitable business would have
been the production of soda ash, but at that time only
6 companies of the world had the technology to
produce it. But Tata Chemicals prepared its formula
on its own. The second task was to produce at least
400 tonnes daily. Darbari Seth, a Chemical Engineer,
laid the entire outline of the chemical plant in front of
J.R.D. Agreeing with him J.R.D. handed over the
responsibility of engineering, fabrication and
installation of new machines at Mithapur to him.
Darbari Seth and his team completed the work of installation
by working day and night and at the same time ensured that
they all worked together. As soon as the plant was ready, the
target of producing 400 tons per day was also handed over to
the same team. Within the first fortnight, production from the
plant reached 545 tonnes per day.

Today Tata Chemicals Ltd. Is the second largest soda ash
producer in the world. Other than India, its production units
are in other countries like UK, Kenya and USA.


Apart from this, the company also produces sodium
bicarbonate, sulphuric acid, sodium tripoli phosphate on a
large scale. Apart from this, Tata Chemicals Ltd. (TCL) is the
largest producer of urea and phosphate fertilizers in India. Not
only this, it is also the largest producer of branded iodized salt
in India.

In 2003, Tata Chemicals gained control of Hindustan Lever
Chemicals, the leader in the phosphate category in West
Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. Hindustan Lever Chemicals
factory is in Haldia and Tata Chemicals factories are in
Mithapur (Gujarat) and Babrala (UP). A plant for its nitrogen
fertilizer production in Babrala was also in progress. Tata
Chemicals has introduced a number of branded productions
over the years due to its large and diverse dealer network and
has made good inroads through farmer training programs.

Tata Kisan Kendras have done revolutionary work in this
direction. Tata Chemicals also exports 10-15 percent of its
products.

## Tata Motors

## T ata Motors is the largest automobile company in

India. According to estimates in 2007-08, its revenue
was ` 35,651 crore. It ranks highest in India in
production in each category of commercial vehicles. As
far as passenger vehicles are concerned, it is counted
among the top three manufacturers. The company
ranks fourth in truck production and second in bus
production. Thus, it is a well-known name in the field
of automobiles worldwide.
Telco (currently Tata Motors) was founded in 1945 and
started production of vehicles in 1954. Today more than 40
lakh Tata vehicles are running on the roads of India and they
have entered every corner of the country. Tata Motors’
manufacturing units are located in Jamshedpur, Pune,
Lucknow and Pantnagar (Uttarakhand).

In 1998, after many years of hard work and research Ratan
Tata launched the first Indian car known as Indica. Cars under
its brand are Indigo and many other names were subsequently
produced and exported to many countries. In 2004, Tata
Motors acquired the Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company of
South Korea. It was the second largest truck manufacturer in
South Korea. In this way, the restructured Tata Daewoo
Commercial Vehicle Company launched several new vehicles in
the Korean market and also started exporting them to other
countries. In 2006, Tata Motors launched a mini truck in the
market. It was quite successful and is in great demand in the
market. As a result, its production has reached above 2,50,000
annually today.


In 2005, under a joint venture with Fiat, it has set up a new
unit in Maharashtra to produce Fiat cars as well as Fiat
powertrans and Tata cars.

The company is setting up new units at Dharwad in
Karnataka and Sanand in Gujarat. The company has a
network of around 3,500 centres for dealerships, sales &
service and spare parts. It is also a distributor in the country of
Fiat brand cars.

It also operates businesses in England, Thailand, South
Korea and Spain through subsidiaries companies and ancillary
units. These include the acquisition and operation of two well-
known British brands Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008.

Earlier in 2006, Tata Motors formed a joint venture with
Brazil’s Marcopolo, which is world-renowned in the
construction of buses and coaches, which will produce fully
manufactured buses and coaches for export to the Indian
market and other countries. In the same year the company
became associated as a joint venture with the Thonburi
Automotive Assembly Plant Company of Thailand, so that the
company could produce and market the van for supply in
Thailand. In 2008, the production of trucks called ‘Xenon
pickup trucks’ had started at the Tata plant in Thailand.

Company had made a good place in the international market
as well. Company’s commercial and passenger vehicles are
being marketed in many countries of Europe, Middle-East
Asia, South-East Asia, South Asia, Africa and South America.
Its joint ventures or franchises are working in Bangladesh,
Ukraine, Kenya, Senegal and Russia.

The most important factor in the growth of the company in
the last fifty years is - customer’s need and satisfaction. For
this there has been a tradition of research and development.
2,500 scientists and engineers of the company’s Engineering
Research Centre established in the year 1966, have made
specific cooperation in the form of latest technologies and
products for the use of the company. Apart from Pune,
Jamshedpur, Lucknow in India, the research and development


(R&D) centres of the company are working abroad in South
Korea, Spain and England.

Tata Motors made the first light commercial vehicle in India
and the Indigenous passenger car Indica in 1998. It made
significant inroads in the Indian market within its journey of
two years only.

## In January 2008, Tata Motors showcased

## the Nano, an affordable price car. This was

## in keeping with Ratan Tata’s promise that

## he made with his countrymen promising an

## excellent low-cost car. It was named the

## ‘people’s car’. It was a laud effort for the

## world automobile industry. Nano is a car

## that fulfils the dream of a comfortable and

## safe journey for millions of families within

## their purchasing capacity. It is available in

## both standard and deluxe classes, in India.

## In the standard category, it has been priced

## at ` 1 lakh (excluding VAT and traffic

## expenses). That is why people have named it

## ‘Lakhtakiya Car’.

This car has been built by assessing the needs of a common
family. Accordingly, it has a relatively spacious passenger
compartment, so that one can sit and spread legs easily. It is
spacious enough for 4 passengers. It has an outstanding
standard of regulatory safety standards required in India.
Even in terms of pollution standards, it will emit much less
pollution than all the two-wheeler being built in India. Keeping
its weight light helped maximize performance by the energy


consumed per unit. Due to high efficiency in energy
consumption, the emission of carbon dioxide is also
significantly reduced. Overall, this car is designed to be very
useful for a small family.

Tata Motors can pave the way for an automobile revolution in
the market by building many new advanced vehicles, in the
coming years. All these vehicles will be technologically
advanced and manufactured according to customer needs.
These will use environment friendly technologies and energy.
The Research and Development department of Tata Motors
strives for this overall.

Tata Motors is also engaged in engineering and automotive
solutions through its ancillary units. Apart from this, it is also
involved in manufacturing construction equipment, vehicle
parts, machine tools and factory automation solutions, and
manufacturing and service operation of automotive and
computer applications parts.

Tata Motors is also conscious of its social commitments. It is
a signatory to the United Nations’ Global Compact and is
engaged in community and labour-oriented social work in
accordance with its principles.

Accordingly, it is working in harmony with the welfare works
and community development for the welfare of the rural
population around its production units.

company started manufacturing PABX sets in Ahmedabad. It
later contacted an American company.

was founded in 1995. It introduced new rules in the field of
precious jewellery, challenging the dynastic tradition of
goldsmiths. It caused excitement by entering the market with
the guarantee of purity of Tata. Only then was it found that in
India, jewellery manufacturers in the name of pure gold have
been fooling the general public for centuries. It made the
people aware with about the prevalence of rampant corruption
through its criterion of technology in the purity based on
personal belief. It was the brand Tanishq, which used an
advanced technique such as karat meter to provide a means of
testing the purity of gold without harming the gold jewellery.

Tanishq established a production centre and base of new
research in the field of jewellery making in India. Spread over
an area of 1,35,000 sq ft, its large unit is equipped with all
modern machines and equipment. The factory set up at Hosur
in Tamil Nadu centralizes the work of artisans making various
styles of jewellery. On the one hand, they are artisans who are
exploited by jewellery makers by making them work on less
wages, while Tanishq’s artisans are getting excellent working
conditions and reasonable salary and other facilities. This is
the reason why Tanishq is in great progress today and its
marketing branches have opened in many cities.

## The Taj Group

## J amsetji Tata had four main plans in mind, which he

wanted to fulfil in his lifetime. They were—steel,
hydroelectric power, a research university, and a hotel
compared to no other hotel in Asia. He wanted to build
a world class hotel in Bombay. Only this wish of his
could be fulfilled during his lifetime when the
magnificent Taj Mahal Hotel was inaugurated in 1903
in Bombay. Today Taj is the synonym of hospitality.
Taj is the best in the world in terms of customer
satisfaction. The Taj Group has opened training
centres for excellent training of its employees.
At the ‘World Travel Ceremony’ held in Kuala Lumpur
(Malaysia), the Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai was unanimously
declared the best hotel in the Asia-Pacific region by all travel
agents in the world.

In Kerala, Taj has started a project called ‘Green Tourism’,
where specialist Ayurvedic treatment is available in five hotels
of Taj Group.

The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, Mumbai have made history
since its inauguration in 1903. Many Maharajas, princes,
presidents and other prominent personalities have received
hospitality of the Taj.

The Taj is also an excellent specimen of architecture which
offers a fascinating view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway
of India. Besides foreign crafts and techniques there is a lot of
use of Indian crafts and artifacts in it.


As a result of additional construction, the number of rooms in
the hotel doubled, in 1970. The tower wing was speculated by a
noted American sculptor named Melton Bekker. Dale Keller, a
Swiss designer from Hong Kong, was in charge of its interiors.
Indian essence was kept alive in it by giving special touch like
the Udaipur style relief panels, Tanjore style columns, Indian
restaurants etc. In 1990, the rooms on the top four floors were
modernized again.

For almost a century, the Taj Mahal Palace has become a
kind of store house for a variety of paintings and artistic things
from all over the world. These things are displayed in large
numbers here.

### Services

The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower has 565 rooms and 46 suites
and its facilities are also of excellent standard. It also provides
personal butler service for the Taj Club room and suites. These
butlers play an important role as a guide and assistant here.

Hotel business services include wireless Internet and
broadband Internet access, colour copiers, in-house
conferencing, mobile, laptops and portable printers on rent;
translation, interpreters and secretarial services are also
available on rent; and multimedia computers are also
available. Other services include 24-hour dining, baby-sitting,
beauty salon, car hire, currency exchange, dry cleaning, florist,
house doctor, laundry and travel services etc.

## The Taj and the attack of 26/11: On

## November 26, 2008, two of the big hotels in

## Bombay were attacked by Pakistani

## terrorists, the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower

## Hotel was also one of them were the

## terrorists caused immense destruction.

## Overall, there was considerable loss of life

## and property. The 31 people who died here


## included the staff along with the guests. Till

## the time Mumbai was freed from the

## clutches of the terrorists after a siege of

## more than 59 hours, they had killed 183

## people and wounded 239 people in 10 places

## in total.

Taj was in bad shape. Blood-soaked rooms and corridors,
gunshot hole, grenades ravages, burnt interior. Many Taj
employees, including guests and security personnel, also lost
their lives. The Taj’s general manager’s wife and two children
also died in the fire. But like the people of Mumbai, the Taj
employees also did not lose courage and pledged to bring the
Taj back to a dignified place.

## Re-welcoming of guest in Taj: The Taj

## Mahal Palace Hotel reopened on December

## 21, 2008, twenty-four days after the terrorist

## attack, and guests began arriving. By

## December 21, booking was completed in all

## its restaurants. On the occasion of the

## reopening of the hotel, Ratan Tata

## remembered the guests and security

## personnel who lost their lives in the terrorist

## attack and also thanked the employees who

## wrote a new chapter by saving the lives of

## others risking their own life.

## The Tree of Life: A memorial called ‘The

## Tree of Life’ was also released in memory of

## those who lost their lives in the hotel, in the


## attacks of 26/11. Based on this, the names of

## those 31 people were recorded, so that they

## can always be remembered. The basis of this

## monument is the artwork of Jaidev Baghel,

## which was installed near the steps of the 5th

## floor, where it was found unshaken by the

## terrorist attack in its former position.

After this terror attack, Taj established a fund to help not
only the people who lost lives in the Taj Hotel but also the
victim of other parts of the city and the families of the
deceased.

In this terrorist attack, many employees of the army, police,
fire service, hotel, guests and general people also lost their
lives and many were injured. Well-wishers from India as well
as from outside India sent their best wishes to restore the hotel
and provide relief to the victims.

### Taj	Public	Service	Welfare	Trust

In response, the Taj group set up the Taj Public Service
Welfare Trust. Its main objective was to provide immediate
relief to the victims of the attack and the relatives of the
deceased, be it ordinary people, security forces personnel or Taj
employees or people from other institutions suffering from
terror. This trust will continue to serve the victims of violence,
natural calamities and other maleficent events in the years to
come.

Apart from India Hotels Company Ltd. Sir Dorabji Tata
Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust also approved valuable initial
contributions in it. Consent from the government was also
considered for contributions from foreign donors.

A board of trustees was also formed for this, which included
Sir Ratan Tata, N.A. Sunavala, A.P. Goyal, R.K.
Krishnakumar, R.N. Bickson and A.K. Mukerjee.


Ratan Tata worked patiently in this difficult time of the
terrorist attack; but he was very upset by the negligence of the
state machinery, the lateness and the lack of coordination
among government agencies. While expressing his thoughts on
taking responsibility of taking care of his own self, people and
the institutions himself, he expressed his dissatisfaction clear
and well.

## Some Important Achievements

## R atan Tata has amazing management capabilities. He knew

the value of time and used to make decisions accordingly. He
also had to face failures, but he did not lose courage. He
learned the mantra to climb the steps of success through his
failures.

### Acquisition	of	Steel	Company	Corus

‘Corus’ emerged in 1999, when British Steel merged with its
rival Dutch steel company Hoogovens. The Corus employed
47,300 employees, including 24,000 at its various sites in the
UK—Port Talbot, Scunthorpe and Rotherham.

Over the past few years, there was a significant reduction in
its profit due to increase in raw material prices and rise in
energy expenditure both in UK and Netherlands. Therefore, it
was forced to join an institute whose production cost was low.
When the sale of the Corus Steel Plant was decided, the big
companies of the steel sector came into the fray. Tata Steel of
Ratan Tata was also one of them. But then it was not
considered to be a strong buyer. All kinds of thoughts were in
the air. The first was that Ratan Tata is not a serious
contender, the second was that the Corus purchase would
prove to be a loss deal for him. But Ratan Tata kept quiet at
that time. He had made up his mind on what has to be done. It
was not in his nature to retreat after making decisions, no
matter what the challenge is. The same happened in this case.
In the acquisition of Corus, he got a huge challenge from the
Brazilian firm CSN.

The deal between Corus and CSN would have produced the
fifth largest steel company in the world, with an annual
production of 24 million tonnes. This would allow Corus access
to low-cost and high-quality cast iron, which was available at
the Casa de Pedra mine of CSN. Along with this, it would also
have access to the fast-emerging markets of South America.


Whether the deal was with Tata or CSN in both cases, the
new company would become the fifth largest steel producer in
the world and it went into foreign ownership only a decade
after becoming the British steel company Corus.

The Tata group joined the acquisition movement with an offer
of 455 pence per share. Along with Brazilian CSN, Russia’s
Severstal was also interested in its acquisition. The Corus
Board put its bid at 4.3 billion pounds. Severstal later
expressed his reluctance to take over, but CSN. raised its bid to
475 pence per share. Meanwhile, there was intense discussion
between CSN and Corus on the issue that a proposal of 500
pence per share came from Tata, which proved to be a serious
setback for both. Both were quite surprised, but C.S.N. but
C.S.N. raised its bid to 515 pence per share.

Corus is Europe’s second-largest steel producer, with 12
billion pounds of annual revenue, crude steel production of over
20 million tonnes, that is mainly produced in England and the
Netherlands.

The Corus consists mainly of three operating divisions-
Striped products, long products and distribution & building
systems. It has its own network of global sales offices and
service centres, employing approximately 42,000 people.

Corus is a major supplier in the world’s developed market. Its
goods are supplied to the manufacturing, automotive,
packaging, mechanical and electrical engineering, metal goods
and oil and gas sectors.

After the acquisition, Corus is now an ancillary of Tata Steel.
Today Tata Steel has business in about 50 countries around
the world, including Corus, Tata Steel, Thailand and Nat Steel
Asia. Around 80,000 employees are employed for the Tata Steel
Group in five continents of the world. The crude steel
production capacity of the group is estimated at 28 million
tonnes.

It is estimated that by 2011-12, the combined production
capacity of Tata Steel and Corus will be 40 million tonnes and


the total turnover will reach $ 32 billion. This acquisition is the
largest acquisition by an Indian company abroad.

The bid for the acquisition lasted for eight rounds. Brazil’s
CSN made its final offer bid up to 603 pence per share. Tata
Steel made the bid in its favour by offering 5 pence more i.e.
608 pence per share. Therefore, the last bet was in the name of
Tata, which did not let its own and the country’s head bow
down and thus created a new history.

## Acquisition	of	Jaguar Land Rover

## J aguar, founded in 1922, is the world’s leading luxury and

sports car manufacturer. Land Rover has been working in this
sector since 1948. Jaguar Land Rover is made up of two big
British car brands. Its manufacturing units are located in
England.

The company has over 16,000 employees, of which around
3,500 are engineers. It has manufacturing units in Whitley and
Geydon, UK.

Three models of Jaguar- XF, XJ and XK, are manufactured at
Birmingham plant and those of Land Rover-Defender,
Discovery-3, Rover Sport, etc, are manufactured at Solihull.

This business is a great means for England to earn money. 78
percent of Land Rover cars are exported to 169 countries. On
the other hand, 70 percent of Jaguars are exported to 63
countries. Importers and franchise sellers are resorted to for
sale to customers.

On March 26, 2008, Tata Motors purchased the Jaguar Land
Rover business from Ford Motor Company for US $ 2.3 billion.
Many companies of the world were trying to buy these famous
brands, but only Ratan Tata got success.

Ratan Tata himself was present at the Jaguar Land Rover
headquarters in Gaydon at the post-acquisition transfer
ceremony. Leading officers were present on behalf of the
acquired company.

Speaking on the occasion, Ratan Tata said that this is a
memorable moment for Tata Motors. Jaguar and Land Rover
are the two big British brands, which have a global market and
have substantial growth potential. Jaguar Land Rover team
will have our full support. The company will continue to have
its own personal identity. Similarly, it will continue to work in
accordance with its previously targeted business objectives.


In the procurement regime, royalty-free continuous
ownership of the intellectual property rights construction
plant, two design centers in England and a global network of
national sales companies, were given to the Jaguar Land
Rover.

A long-term agreement has been signed for the supply of
engines, stamping and spare parts to Jaguar Land Rover.
Other areas of cooperation by Ford will be the availability of
information technology, accounting and testing facilities. The
two companies will continuously cooperate in the field of design
and development. Ford Motor Company will continue to
provide financial assistance to Jaguar Land Rover buyers and
customers for a duration in the transition period.

The deal will provide an important opportunity for Tata
Motors to establish a strong footprint in the international
automobile sector. With this, Tata Motors which was earlier
known only for manufacturing low-cost cars will be able to
make a mark in the luxury car category.

The deal also came as a big relief for the Ford company, as a
lot of money was being spent on the creation of these two
luxurious brands and the expenditure was more than the
income. On the other hand, it was not able to get sufficient
customers. As a result, the company was incurring heavy
losses for the last two-three years.

## Entry of	Land Rover Cars in the Indian

## Market

# A lmost a year after the acquisition, Tata

## Motors launched the Jaguar Land Rover car

## in the Indian market in the last week of

## June 2009. The three cars of the Rover

## models—Discovery-3, Range Rover and

## Sport—can each cost between ` 65 lakh and

## ` 1 crore.

While introducing these luxury cars to Indian customers,
Ratan Tata said that ‘With this, Land Rover brand cars have
entered India. Although it had entered here in the past years,
but the relationship with the customers here was severed in a
few years. ‘Even after the acquisition by Tata, during the
economic downturn, its sales fell by one-third as compared to
earlier sales, during the last one year. Keeping this in mind,
Ratan Tata said, ‘Jaguar Land Rover could not be praised in
times of economic recession, but they are excellent products
with their superb production. After coming out of the recession,
we can say that it was a difficult decision to take ownership of
it. But as an Indian, I am proud to be the owner of these
brands. We will definitely bring back their lost dignity’.

Several prominent officials including Jaguar Land Rover
Chief Executive Officer David Smith were present on this
occasion in Mumbai. Jaguar Land Rover series can be
compared to Mercedes-S, Audi-6, BMW-7, etc.

With the entry of Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors has
become a company engaged in the business of expensive luxury
cars as well as low-cost cars for the common people.

## Paramount in Generosity

## T he money that Jamsetji and his sons earned during the

industrialization of the country was not spent on their comfort
and luxury. He put most of that money in the trusts for the
welfare of the people, so that it can be used only for their
welfare.

Earning money for yourself and earning for others are both
opposite poles. But here the mention is of that business family
which has earned money for its country through all the
struggles, troubles and dangers and has formed and efficiently
operated many trusts to spend it in the service of the
countrymen in various ways.

### Social	Welfare	Works	of	Jamsetji

The group which Jamsetji Tata started with the
establishment of a textile factory in central India in 1870, is
now famous in the country and abroad. Jamsetji’s thought and
vision led to the foundation of the textile industry as well as
the steel and energy industries in the country. He laid the
foundation for technical education, started public welfare
works and thus paved the way for India to reach the gateway
of 21st century.

After Jamsetji’s death, his elder son Sir Dorabji Tata took
charge of the Tata group and with the support his younger
brother Sir Ratan Tata and uncle R.D. Tata he gave form to
Jamsetji’s dream.

The spirit of trusteeship is a kind of by-product of the
business of Jamsetji and his sons, through which they had to
meet the needs of the country. His extensive ideological
thinking gave him the idea of doing something beyond his
business interests and the determination to give a concrete
form to it. The desire to develop his country as an
industrialized nation was deeply rooted in Jamsetji. Along with
this, he was filled with the passion to train the youth of our
country. Under this idea, from 1892 onwards, he started


sending deserving youth to study abroad by giving scholarships
for higher education. When the British opened up the Indian
Civil Service (equivalent to today’s Indian Administrative
Service) to the Indians for recruitment, it was his heartfelt
desire that more Indians should join it. So he started giving
scholarships to the worthy people. A survey in 1924 made it
clear that out of every 5 Indian ICS at that time, one was a
Tata Scholar. Among the people who were benefited from the
Tata Endowment Fund at that time, few are- J.C. Koyaji,a
member of the Viceroy’s Executive, B.N. Rao, Chief Justice
Bombay High Court, Dr. Jeevaraj N. Mehta (later Chief
Minister of Gujarat), Dr. Raja Ramanna, K.R. Narayanan
(later became President of India), V.V. Narlikar, J.V. Narlikar,
etc.

```

```

## Contribution	of	Sir Ratan Tata

## J amsetji was fortunate in the fact that his sons also had

similar rites. His younger son Ratan Tata was very kind and
generous hearted and was always ready to help any person or
institution in trouble. The national sentiment had merged with
his personal views. He was a man of extensive and balanced
views.

Charity or philanthropy is possible only when there is
passion inside the person and he is deeply attached to any
thought and action. Then only he can be willing to give time to
it as well as cooperate and help financially. During his lifetime,
Sir Ratan Tata had identified many cases where according to
him there was need of cooperation and help.

Gopalakrishna Gokhale founded the ‘Servants of India
Society’ in Poona in June 1905. His aim was to prepare selfless,
intelligent workers for India. Such workers, who can devote
their lives to the service of the country.

## At the request of Gopalkrishna Gokhale,

## Sir Ratan Tata gave assistance of ` 10,000

## every year to Gopalakrishna Gokhale’s

## organization for ten years. This amount was

## to be spent by the institution for the welfare

## of the weaker sections of the society.

Similarly, he also helped the non-cooperation movement
being run by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa. This movement
was being carried out on the apartheid policy of the then
British Government and the issue of mistreatment of the
people of the Indian community. Like other patriots, Sir Ratan
also believed that it was a legitimate and cooperative
movement. The repression movement by the British
government was in full swing against it.


## On the appeal of cooperation by Mahatma

## Gandhi, Sir Ratan sent a sum of ` 1.25 lakh

## in instalments for five years from 1909 to

## 1913 to Gandhiji so that he could continue

## his movement.

Expressing his gratitude to Sir Ratan, Gandhiji said that his
cooperation has led to the realization that India has now
woken up. His help will prove to be a great force for our
movement.

In 1912, Sir Ratan Tata proposed to help the University of
London to set up a bench that suggested the causes of poverty
and ways to overcome them. A plan was submitted by the
university. A Chair (Peeth) was established in 1913 after Sir
Ratan Tata’s approval. Sir Ratan agreed to pay 1,400 pounds
annually for this project for three years. In 1916, it was
extended for the next five years. Even after the death of Sir
Ratan Tata, the trust formed in his name continued to grant
this bench till 1931. In these nineteen years, many scholars of
the university did research work on the status of workers in
various occupations and got it published. Today the ‘Sir Ratan
Tata Foundation’ is a permanent institution at the London
School of Economics.

## Between 1913 and 1917, Sir Ratan gave an

## economic grant of ` 75,000 to implement the

## archaeological mining project of Pataliputra.

## As a result of this excavation, many items of

## archaeological importance were revealed.

## Items received are displayed in Patna’s

## museum. This was his immense urge to

## bring national pride to the fore.


## Sir Ratan Tata was also an admirer of art

## and culture. He was also an enthusiastic

## traveller, who travelled to many places in

## the country and abroad. During his travels,

## he collected many items of art and cultural

## importance. In 1919, the collection was

## valued at ` 5 lakh. After his death,

## according to his will this entire collection

## was transferred to the Prince of Wales

## Museum in 1921, where it is still on display.

This is just a specimen of the fulfilment of the social concerns
of Sir Ratan. During his lifetime he did many works of
philanthropy. These include assistance to victims of disasters
like flood, famine, fire, earthquake etc. and periodic assistance
to hospitals, monuments, schools and many other social utility
institutions etc.

His approach on how to use a trust fund was quite clear. In
1913, he put forward an outline of it. According to him, all the
fields of education, teaching and industry were within its scope
and all the things of general public work were included in it.
The employment of persons who were suitable and capable in
reaching the depth of cases for social, economic and political
fulfilment was its another feature. Along with this, he would
agree to support any plan and experiment only when it was
carefully prepared and considered on all aspects.

## Sir Ratan Tata Trust

## A fter the death of Sir Ratan Tata in 1918, the Sir Ratan Tata

Trust was set up with ` 80 lakh. It is one of the oldest grantors
in India. After his death, the public welfare works carried out

by him were continued by the trust formed in his name.

In 1995, a strategy was prepared for the activities of Sir
Ratan Tata Trust from 1995 to 2000 under the leadership of
Ratan Tata. It had to do something beyond the traditional
welfare works so that these welfare works could be planned for
national development.

For this, it was decided to focus on the following areas to
provide grants-

- Rural Living and Community Areas
- Education
- Health


- Arts and culture
- Public initiative.

Under this, around 65 new grants were approved for the year
2000-2001 and the trust sanctioned grants worth about 16
crores for various works. This is just one example. In later
years, the number of schemes offered and its monetary size
increased.

After the introduction of the new strategy by Ratan Tata, the
Trust has been providing major support to programs to
improve the standard of living of the rural poor and the rural
community.

Under this, special attention is being paid to the following
areas-

- Non-agricultural works, help to the women groups notably.
- Rural community.
- Relief to communities suffering from natural disasters.
- Research on major problems in rural area.
- Emphasis on development of human resources in rural
areas.
- Emphasis on proper management of resources to increase
agricultural production.

In the field of education, the trust is focused on two main
categories — 1. Schooling, 2. Higher education. The objective of
the grants has been to support community education in this
area. The main emphasis is also on quality education. It is an
attempt to achieve this by increasing the level of knowledge of
teachers by training and by paying adequate attention to the
education being imparted in the classrooms. To keep the
children in schools, various programs are being provided
outside the school also. Special attention is also being given to
value-based education.

The Trust is supporting community-based health programs in
the health sector. For this, attention is also being given to


cooperation of public and individual joint ventures and to
develop an activist organization of public health professionals.

Various types of grants are being given to the art sector by
the Sir Ratan Tata Trust for the safety and security of things
of archaeological importance.

The Trust is also supporting such programs in which people
of both the male and female sections are being made capable
according to the changing social changes.

The trust is also providing grants to institutions working in
some selected areas. The condition of the grant is only that the
work has the desired effect on the society or it is a work of
important nature in some area.

Along with the institutions, the trust is also giving grants to
individual people and small institutions. This work is being
done by ‘Sir Ratan Tata Small Grants Program’. In this, grants
are given mainly to small institutions engaged in welfare
works and people working for educational and health purposes.

## Sir Dorabji Tata Trust

## S ir Dorabji Tata Trust was established in 1932 by

Dorabji, the elder son of Jamsetji Tata. Shortly before
his death Dorabji had bequeathed this trust to his
entire estate, which at that time was 1 crore rupees. It
included his significant stakes of Tata Sons.
Although Sir Dorabji spent most of his time in fulfilling his
father’s big dreams, still he took out time for public welfare
works. One of the two trusts he founded three months before
his death was the Lady Tata Memorial Trust. It was of
relatively small stature and was primarily for research in the
area of leukemia. The second Sir Dorabji Tata Trust was of a
large scale. It was due to the generosity of this trust that some
of the leading institutions of India were established, such as-

1. Tata Institute of Social Sciences (1936).
2. Tata Memorial Hospital (1941).
3. Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (1945).
4. National Centre for Performing Arts (1966).


After the death of J.R.D., honouring his wish the Dorabji
Tata Trust helped the M.S. Swaminathan Research
Foundation to establish J.R.D. Tata Centre for Ecotechnology.

Jamsetji Tata had a strong desire to establish a ‘School of
Medical Research into Tropical Medicine’. Dorabji wanted to
establish it in 1912 to honour his wish; But for some reasons
this could not be possible then. The wish of the two was
fulfilled in 1999, when the ‘Sir Dorabji Tata Centre for
Research in Tropical Diseases’ was established at the Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore. In 2004, the Trust contributed
in the establishment of the School of Rural Development,
Tuljapur and Tata Medical Centre, Calcutta. From its
beginning till 2006, the Trust distributed approximately 380
crore and all this was given to support creative work.

Apart from this, Tata Trusts are contributing in many areas
in different parts of the country. A series of Tata trusts will be
sufficient to demonstrate their work and scope. These are:

- Sir Ratan Tata Trust.
- Sir Dorabji Tata Trust.
- Jamsetji Tata Trust.
- J.N. Tata endowment.
- J.R.D. Tata Trust.
- The J.R.D. And Thelma J. Tata Trust.
- Lady Meherbai D Tata Education Trust.
- Lady Tata Memorial Trust.
- R. D. Tata Trust.
- M.K. Tata Trust.
- Tata Social Welfare Trust.
- Tata Education Trust.

The Tata group companies are also engaged at their levels in
developing their surroundings and making lives of people


happier. Not only this, they are involved in public welfare
works even in remote areas of the country outside their region.

## Relief Work During Disasters

## T ata’s tradition of relief work during natural

```
disasters began with the earthquake in Quetta in
```
1934. The specialty of the relief work done by Tata is
that whether it is relief work or rehabilitation, they do
all the work themselves with their own resources and
through their people.
One example will be sufficient. In 1993, there was a great
earthquake in Latur in the morning and a supreme meeting
was called same day in the evening for relief work, but before
the meeting itself, several groups of Tata employees had
departed with adequate furnishings and materials to provide
relief to the people of earthquake-affected area. Where else can
one find such passion? Other employees donated blood and sent
it for the victims. On this front, the Tata Relief Committee set
up for the eastern part of the country, helped the earthquake
victims just like the relief committee of its western part. The
Relief Committee of the Western Region took up various relief
and rehabilitation schemes and completed them. To live in
these, construction of residential, establishment of schools and
establishment of health centers are the main. The Sir Dorabji
Tata Trust took up the task of establishing water facilities and
improving the condition of agriculture and animals. Through
the Relief and Rehabilitation Division of his Tata Relief
Committee, Ratan Tata helped the government of Gujarat by


constructing 22 schools in the earthquake affected Rapar
taluka of Kutch. These school buildings are built to the best of
engineering standards and are seismic.

Even during the Kargil War, as per its practice, Tata chose
the path of functional cooperation, rather than merely
concluding his duty by paying a check. Tata consulted with the
Ministry of Defence and set up a special Tata Defence Welfare
Corps Fund in the Ministry of Defence. In this, companies and
employees of the Tata group donated an amount of Rs 12 crore.

This amount was not only to help the martyred or injured in
Kargil or their family members, but also to help the victims of
other wars and conflicts before it. It was also for the soldiers of
the security forces who were in Sri Lanka conflict, counter
insurgency, peace keeping work and those who became crippled
due to war; for widows of the martyrs and for giving grants for
higher education of their children. The officers of Tata and the
Security Army used to meet for necessary allocation in every 6
months.

Ratan Tata is the chairman of the multi-purpose trusts of the
Tata Group. The idea of creative work for Tata philanthropy is
a revolutionary idea for the traditional charitable
organizations whose work was only to donate. Today, the ‘Tata
family’ is one of the family among the few philanthropists in
the country, which is involved in the development of the
country, battling with problems at the individual, local and
national levels. Along with helping in the development of the
country, Ratan Tata is associated with all the welfare works.

## Nano: Manufacturing of People’s Car


## T he world’s cheapest car project began in 2003 under

Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors. Ratan Tata got
this inspiration from the troubles of millions of two-

wheeler drivers who cannot afford expensive cars.
Therefore, take necessary travels with their family of

3-4 members on a two-wheeler. In this way, they
complete their journey by risking not only their own

life but also of their entire family. Ratan Tata had a
dream to build and deliver a car within their budget to

ease their troubles. Tata made the necessary changes
to the manufacturing process to meet its design

criteria to make a low-budget car possible,
emphasizing on innovation and it asked the suppliers

to give form to new design concepts. The car was
designed keeping in mind the changes suggested by

Ratan Tata. As compared to the Maruti-800, the Nano
has 21 percent more space inside it. According to

CRISIL Rating Agency, the entry of Nano into the
market would expand India’s car business by 65

percent. Tata Motor has kept the initial price of the
Nano at ` 1, 00, 000, hence it has also been called

Lakhtakia car. It is the lowest priced car in the world.


It can also be purchased by families with an annual
income of 1 lakh rupees. In this sense it is actually a
People’s Car.
Tata Motors showcased the Nano model at the 9th Auto Expo
on January 10, 2008. Due to the relatively low price and other
features, it was a centre of attraction.

The Tata Nano is a small four-seater city car. Its engine is
installed in the rear. It has been greatly appreciated due to its
low price and environmental relative characteristics. The main
idea is that the Tata group will produce the Nano on a large
scale, especially its electric model. Along with sales in India, it
will be exported worldwide. The car will be produced in one
standard and two luxury models. This project to manufacture
the world’s cheapest car started in 2003 on the initiative of the
Chairman of Tata Motors, Ratan Tata. The success of Tata
Motors in the production of a mini truck in 2005 also inspired
for the development of Nano.

## Tata’s initial goal was to produce the

## world’s least expensive car, with a starting

## price of ` 100,000 and 2,300 dollars in the

## US dollars. This price remained despite the

## fact that the material price had risen by 13

## to 23 percent within five years of developing

## the car.

Tata Nano’s electric model is also expected to be in great
demand overseas. Director General for Energy and Transport,
European Commission Matthias Ruete is of the view that the
entire Europe, like other countries, is eagerly awaiting the
commercial marketing of Tata Nano. But considering the
adverse effect of carbon dioxide on the environment, it would
be more appropriate to develop an electric model of Nano.

### Launch	of	Nano	Project


## In fact, the Nano project started in 2003

## when Tata Motors formed a team of four

## members and asked them to complete a new

## project. The project was the development of

## a new four-wheeler traffic vehicle. At that

## time it was only said that it would cost `

## 1,00,000. At that time the lowest priced car

## cost around 2.5 lakh rupees. It was also

## clarified that the trust and safety of the

## customers and environmental requirements

## have to be taken care of in this.

The design team considered several designs and looked at
alternative methods of vehicle manufacturing and tried to
draw some conclusions from the then small cars.

The team considered a number of options and situations, such
as the use of plastic instead of metal, the decrease of internal
space or the use of a low power engine. The focus at that time
was to keep the price low. Various techniques were tried. But a
question remains incomplete on how much the customer will be
satisfied. When it was decided that the autorickshaw approach
would not work for the development of a suitable car, other
ideas emerged, such as- Doorless, where there is an iron door,
cloth ceiling, plastic doors, etc.

But Ratan Tata did not agreed on any of these suggestions.
He had a clear idea that a whole car was needed at a low price,
not a car-like structure.

Many ideas were tried. Headlight in different shape, to give
the front part of the car a child-like appearance-big eyes in
small face etc. But Ratan Tata asked for something different.
Repeated changes in the design was painful for the team.


A feature of New Indica was added to the Nano. This led to a
change in the front volume of the Nano and with it a noticeable
change was seen in the look of the car.

This was a delightful turn in the development of the car, as
well as a director. Keeping in mind that the car should look big
too and the wheels on the corners should give the car an
attractive look on the road, a full-fledged shape was developed.
Discussions were made on even the shape and location of the
lower corner of the glass. In all these matters, discussions with
Ratan Tata continued.

By July 2007, a model was almost settled and an idea to work
on it was formulated at the initial stage. That’s when Tata
found the front of the car somewhat awkward, so Tata decided
to increase it. A new design was made and presented to Ratan
Tata in late August, same year, which he immediately
approved.

Now it was the turn of the interior design of the car. There
was ample scope for changes here compared to traditional
designs. Here too the question was of low cost, but there was
no dispute in making it comfortable. The main task was to
balance the cost of the car to suit customer satisfaction as well
as the market. Along with this, the space inside the car had to
be used in such a way that it would look attractive. Many ideas
came up for this. They were implemented after enough
deliberation on the proper suggestions and an attractive shape
could be given to the interior of the car.

As this task was completely different from the traditional
auto engineering, a variety of problems cropped up at each step
of manufacturing, such as installing the engine in the rear
instead of the front. This was a unique idea. This increased
space inside the car, but hindered the balance problem. Some
setups had to be brought forward accordingly. They were
reconciled with the respective setups and then the trial tested
its quality and efficiency. Reforms and trials took place if any
deficiency was found. The floor channel was changed ten times
to meet the prescribed parameters. Similarly, the dashboard
and seats were also changed almost the same number of times.


But the team was busy in their work, because the feeling of
doing something new and unique and the inspiration and
direction of Ratan Tata was with them.

In fact, the idea of installing the engine of the car in the rear
proved revolutionary for the design process. A team to raise
resources for a 35 horse power engine suitable for city cars
travelled all the countries of the world but, no such engine was
found, which was within the budget of the car. Then an engine
manufactured by Tata Motors itself was tested, which was not
found suitable for the Nano. In the end the Fiat Bosch
Electronics Company’s engine eventually passed the trial for
the Nano and was approved.

Installing the engine, gear box and exhaust system behind
the rear seats was a difficult task. This was efficiently
accomplished by the engineering team. The engineering team
should also be appreciated for the fact that it designed and
installed many new structures for the Nano.

A production team formed over the next few months after the
design process was completed. This work was done neatly.
Apart from Tata Motors, people were also taken from outside.
Among them were graduate trainee engineers of IIT,
Kharagpur and Jadavpur University. Overall, it was a mixed
team, a combination of experience and youthful enthusiasm.
This combined fresh ideas with experience and heralded a new
work culture.

The car manufacturing process is a rigorous process. It is not
easy to do it on your own with a few people or companies.
Therefore, the role of other companies and vendors is
important in this, which prepares and supplies all kinds of
products required in car manufacturing. It is easy to get the
work done or done according to the traditional process and
specifications, but creating a new pool of vendors for a new
concept car like the Nano or persuading the elders to make the
products according to the needs of the car was a difficult task,
which was resolved by communicating with them and by
providing necessary technology, design and guidance.
Therefore, a group of about 100 vendors was formed to support


Nano production which could design and supply products
according to the need and can form part of the Nano production
process and make the production of cars on a large scale
possible.

## Singur Land Acquisition Dispute

## T ata Motors chose West Bengal to set up the Nano project.

This could pave the way for the establishment of industries in
West Bengal along with providing employment to a large
number of people. People’s income would have increased,
because many other industries were likely to be established
there, excited by the success of the Nano project. It could
eradicate poverty for many rural people by providing
employment.

Land for the establishment of factory was acquired in the
Singur region of Bengal. This process of land acquisition went
well and the land owners were also satisfied about the amount
of compensation. But during this process, a section of
landowners, who did not live there, some illiterate farmers and
activists of Trinamool Congress, a political party, raised a
dispute by refusing to accept this compensation amount. Due to
the spread of politics, many new dimensions started giving
vent to this dispute. Some started calling it a fertile
agricultural land, while few others started hue and cry on the
compensation of lesser amount. While some questioned the
legitimacy of the acquisition of land, some made it a matter of
forcibly acquiring it.

Although, the West Bengal government wholeheartedly
wanted the Nano project to take place in his state. It created
the necessary environment for this and facilitated the
acquisition of about 997 acres of land.

Mamta Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress and Socialist Unity
Centre were at the forefront in opposing the land acquisition.
He was given full support by civil and human rights groups,
legal institutions and social workers, who are always keen to
help on such opportunities.

Those opposing it had to face criticism and verbal warnings
from the state ruling party C.P.I. (M) and scuffles by its
activist. Survey officials of the state government and Tata


Motors faced heavy resistance at the hands of members of the
‘Singur Krishi Bhoomi Bachao Samiti’.

As a result, the state government had to issue prohibitory
orders under section 144 of the Indian Penal Code; but the
Calcutta High Court declared it illegal.

The government took control of the land earmarked for the
project and began its siege in Tarabad in December 2006 amid
protests. In protest to this, Mamta Banerjee called for a state-
wide shutdown and later started a 25-day hunger strike.
Members of her party vandalized the assembly. A large
number of police forces and activists of the Marxist Party
started guarding the area inside Tarabad, but the siege
continued to be attacked intermittently by the opposing
villagers and other groups. In January 2007, the factory
construction work started on the allotted land. But the
resistance against it was not being stopped, but rather it grew
furious day by day. Due to this, the work of giving practical
shape to the project program was stopped and precious time
was lost.

Seeing the establishment of the Nano project fail in West
Bengal, other states started efforts to pull it into their state. In
the meantime, efforts were made to compromise and to find a
middle path. But no effective solution came out so that the
entire project could be implemented in one place. Rather than
succumb to the pressures, Ratan Tata decided to withdraw
from Singur and announced it on 2 October 2008.

## New Centre for Setting Up

## Nano	Project: Sanand (Gujarat)

## A fter spending a lot of time and resources in West Bengal,

Tata announced shifting its Lakhtakia car Nano project to
Sanand near Ahmedabad in Gujarat. 2,000 crores were to be
spent on this project. But along with it, decision was made to
produce it from another centre for delivery of the car on time.
It is another matter that prior to this announcement, there was
a round of silent talks between the Government of Gujarat and
the Tata representatives. A letter of consent was finally signed
between the State Secretary of Industry and the Managing
Director of Tata Motors. In this agreement, the Chief Minister
of the state, Narendra Modi, also played an effective role, who
ensured the rapid allocation of 1,100 acres of good standing
land. Ratan Tata himself thanked for this. Nearly 60 vendors,
along with Tata Motors, also turned to Sanand to play a
supporting role in Nano production.

It has now been decided that Tata Nano will be mass-
produced from a factory set up in Sanand, Gujarat.

Meanwhile, the production of Nano started at a relatively low
level at the Pantnagar plant, where some production lines of a
truck were converted to conform to Nano production. Similarly,
Tata Motors’ Pune plant also started to work on some
production lines to ensure the entry of Nano into the market at
the scheduled time.

The annual production capacity of the Sanand plant will be
2,50,000 units, which will be extended later.

## Entry of	Nano	in the Market

## O vercoming all the challenges, Tata Motors of Ratan

```
Tata finally made the Nano run on the Indian roads in
July 2009, when its first customer was handed the car
key. Ashok Raghunath, one of the first three
customers of Nano, was handed the car key by
Chairman Ratan Tata himself. It was silver colour of
the Nano LX model. The commencement of the process
of handing over the car to customers on time despite
the precious time wasted due to the Singur
controversy was a good sign for both Nano and Tata
Motors.
```

## Ratan Tata: A Gentle and Digniied

## Personality

## R atan Tata is also known for his gentleness and

humility. He is counted among the leading
businessmen of the world, but still with no sense of
pride. He is unmarried and the entire Tata family is
like a family to him. It would have been difficult for
him to make time for his personal family in the
preparation of this family; but instead of establishing
a separate family, he has raised the entire Tata
Empire as a family. He drives his own car to go to his
office. He travels alone even on trips of long
commercial nature. He does not like caboodle. In India
he like to fly his own plane. He is a skilled pilot. At the
‘Aero India Exhibition’ in 2007, he surprised everyone
by flying as a co-pilot in the fighter aircraft F-16 and
Boeing F-18.
His dealings with his subordinates are tempered with
tenderness. Subordinates also look at him with an eye of
affection and respect. In personal life, he is a fearless man with
strong intentions. It is not possible to bow him down because


he is firm in his thoughts. He is alert to the dangers, but does
not change his path fearing them. It is his nature to accept
challenges. He has established the Tata Group as a commercial
superpower on the global scene. After 2003, he has made a
series of acquisitions and commercial agreements.

He bought his truck manufacturing unit from South Korea’s
Daewoo Motors. Whether it is the case of Indonesia’s largest
coal mine or the steel mills of Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam, he is making his mark everywhere. In addition, he
gained control of Pierre in New York, Ritz-Carlton in Boston
and Campton Place in San Francisco through his Indian Hotels
Group.

In 2004, he bought Tyco International’s global undersea
telecom cables for $ 130 million. Thus, the Tata group rose to
the top of the world as an ‘international call carrier’. With the
purchase of British engineering firm Incat International, Tata
Technologies has become a major supplier in the field of
‘outsourced industrial design’ to American auto and auto space
companies. The subsequent acquisition of Dutch-British steel
company Corus is a major achievement in itself. In one stroke,
Tata Steel increased its finished product and reached out to
auto makers in the US and Europe. With this registered a five-
fold increase in its capacity. The market value of listed Tata
companies has gone from $ 12 billion to $ 62 billion. Similarly,
the sales and profit levels of the group have also gone up and it
has crossed the figure of $29 billion and $2.8 billion
respectively.

Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services
generate 75 percent of revenue from total sales.

With the purchase of the Jaguar Land Rover brand, Tata has
made a significant presence in the luxury car market.

He has introduced a new dimension of his skill and vision by
building the world’s lowest priced car. He is also looking
forward at American aeronautics in the future. He has tied up
with the American company Sikorsky to set up a helicopter
manufacturing factory in Hyderabad.


Ratan Tata wants Tata companies to prove that they can
compete with companies in developed countries and stay
steadfast in emerging markets.

Along with this, they are also discharging social
responsibilities with utmost preparedness. Tata group is also
devoted to public welfare work. He is doing this through his
various trusts. These charitable trusts hold about 66 percent of
Tata Sons’ shares. Tata entered into the retail, telecom, biotech
and other sectors by gaping from the marginal business
companies, which were involved in the cosmetics, paints and
cement business and made a strong footprint in many areas.

Today the Tata Group has around 100 companies and 300
ancillaries, which are trading in 40 businesses. The group is
threaded together through limited employees of the holding
company—Tata Sons and Tata Industries. Both these holding
companies are working under the chairmanship of Ratan Tata.
These two companies only work as controller of strategic vision
and Tata based. These companies help in big agreements.
Bombay House, a group corporate office set up by Ratan Tata,
also leaves its mark on these companies. The nine senior
executives of Tata companies are members of the board of the
Tata company, which discharges corporate responsibility.
Ratan Tata participates in major agreements as chief
executive.

Ratan Tata’s role in the Corus Agreement was pioneering.
This was a large level of work and the amount of money
involved was also very large. Yet Ratan Tata preserved
unwavered. He had faith in himself and his group.

The Tata Steel Company spends millions of rupees annually
on about 800 villages around the site of the establishment,
which are spent on projects such as education, health and
agricultural development.

Jamshedpur, established in 1908, is home to about 7,00,000
people today, with a Tata workforce of around 20,000. Despite
this, Tata Steel has carried the responsibility of all public
facilities and schools in the city.


Ratan Tata is a person of calm nature. Always away from
publicity, he does his work silently without attracting the
attention of the people. He buys companies and brands around
the world. In this way, he has transformed a family group into
a multinational company today. In July 2009, when US
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to India, she expressed
her condolences to the victims of the 26/11 terrorist attacks in
a booklet of condolences kept there. In the Taj Hotel itself, she
discussed matters of mutual interest with selected Indian
industrialists and some important personalities of the business
world. Ratan Tata himself was the host of this meeting.

```

## Something More about Ratan Tata

## W ho can forget the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai, when ten

terrorists crossed the Indian maritime border into Mumbai and
fired indiscriminately at many places and killed many people?
But many people may not know what the Tata group did for its
employees affected by the attack.

The Tata group considered all categories of employees,
including those working as temporary employees for day, on
duty while the hotel was closed.

Employees’ salaries were sent by money order during the
hotel closure. Not only this, a psychiatric unit was also
established to provide counselling facilities to the needy in
collaboration with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. A
mentor was assigned to each employee and it was the
responsibility of the person to act as a ‘single window
clearance’ for all the help the employee sought. Ratan Tata
himself met the families of 80 employees injured or dead in this
attack. Ratan Tata himself asked these family members and
dependents what kind of help they expect from him.


In a record time of twenty days, the Tata group formed a
trust aimed at helping employees. The unique thing in this was
that other people affected by the attack, such as railway
employees, police personnel, people walking on the pavement,
who had no connection with the Tatas’, were also brought
under compensation. During this attack, many vendors who
lost their means of livelihood were provided with hand carts by
Tata.

## All senior managers, including Ratan Tata,

## were busy in the last visit (antim yatra) of

## the dead for three consecutive days. It was a

## really terrible phase. The provided facilities

## mentioned below, in terms of each of its

## deceased employees by Tata costed in range

## from ` 36 to 85 lakh.

1. The lifetime amount equal to the last salary of the employee
to family and dependents.
2. To take full responsibility for the education of dependents
and children anywhere in the world.
3. Lifetime medical care to the whole family and dependents.
4. All debts and advance payments are forgiven—no matter
how large the amount.
5. Lifelong counselling facility for every person.

Mantra is that if you care about your employees then the
employees will also give their life for your product. Companies
thinking of employee interest never have to face a problem like
holding them back.

9. Companies that do not will undoubtedly die.
10. Don’t play games that you don’t understand, even if you see
lots of other people making money from them.
11. Don’t take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of
advice to give — with a few exceptions — generalize whatever
they did. Don’t over-analyze everything.
12. Every time we launch a feature, people yell at us.
13. Everyone thinks only about his profit.
14. Get big quietly, so you don’t tip off potential competitors.
15. Governance is an important thing, not an application where
it suits one so, to micro-control where it suits them on the other
hand.


16. Having said that, I hope that a hundred years from now we
will spread our wings far beyond India.
17. I admire very successful people. But if that success has
been achieved through too much ruthlessness, then I may
admire that person, but I can’t respect him.
18. I am proud of my country. But we need to unite to make a
unified India, free of communalism and casteism.
19. I came seriously close to getting married four times, and
each time I backed off in fear or for one reason or another.
Each occasion was different, but in hindsight when I look at
the people involved, it wasn’t a bad thing what I did. I think it
may have been more complex had the marriage taken place.
20. I do not know how history will judge me, but let me say
that I’ve spent a lot of time and energy trying to transform the
Tatas from a patriarchal concern to an institutional enterprise.
21. I don’t believe in taking right decisions.
22. I followed someone who had very large shoes. He had very
large shoes. Mr. J.R.D. Tata. He was a legend in the Indian
business community. He had been at the helm of the Tata
organization for 50 years. You were almost starting to think he
was going to be there forever.
23. I have always been very confident and very upbeat about
the future potential of India. I think it is a great country with
great potential.
24. I have been constantly telling people to encourage people,
to question the unquestioned and not to be ashamed to bring
up new ideas, new processes to get things done.
25. I have two or three cars that I like, but today, Ferrari
would be the best car I have driven in terms of being an
impressive car.
26. I may have hurt some people along the way, but I would
like to be seen as somebody who has done his best to do the
right thing for any situation and not compromised.
27. I take decisions and then make them right.


28. I think the environment has become more competitive.
That has made the Indian industry more concerned with a) its
customers, b) the quality of its products, and c) its brand image
in the marketplace.
29. I think the Tata Group’s greatest contribution to the
growth of the Indian economy and Indian industry probably
happened in the pre-independence era.
30. I think there are many honest businessmen.
31. I think you can have certain specific rules for engaging
with India... for example, not allowing mineral resources to be
taken out of the country... but there is not a shred of doubt in
my mind that when you open an economy you should do it in
totality.
32. I will certainly not join politics.
33. I would like to be remembered as a clean businessman who
has not partaken in any twists and turns beneath the surface,
and one who has been reasonably successful.
34. I would say that one of the things I wish I could do
differently would be to be more outgoing.
35. I, for one, am not the kind who loves dwelling on the ‘I’.
36. Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard.
37. If history remembers me at all, I hope it will be for this
transformation.
38. If it stands the test of public scrutiny, do it... if it doesn’t
stand the test of public scrutiny then don’t do it.
39. If people like you, they’ll listen to you, but if they trust you,
they’ll do business with you.
40. If there are challenges thrown across, then some
interesting, innovative solutions are found. Without
challenges, the tendency is to go on the same way.
41. If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your
product, you’ve launched too late.


42. If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to
walk far, walk together
43. If you’re interested in the living heart of what you do, focus
on building things rather than talking about them.
44. If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do
more and become more, you are a leader.
45. India has probably lost its position to China as the world’s
workshop. At the same time, it has the power to be ahead of
China when it comes to knowledge. Not that the Chinese are
far behind. They will get there.
46. Indian car buyers have not been exposed to customer care
in a competitive environment.
47. IT and the entire communications business have the
greatest growth potential. But if you’re talking about sheer
size, the steel and auto industries will remain at the top.
48. It needs people really to want to see the UK sitting again,
maybe not as a colonial power, but as an economic power.
49. It would, therefore, be a mark of failure on my part if it
were perceived that Ratan Tata epitomises the Group’s
success.
50. It’s not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen.
51. I’ve never believed protectionism of that kind will lead us
anywhere.
52. Jardine is the largest dealer of Mercedes in the world. They
also sell cars for two or three Japanese makers.
53. Make every detail perfect and limit the number of details to
perfect.
54. Modesty is necessary, even if there is also a need for a
certain amount of national pride. When it comes down to it, we
have managed our country’s economy poorly for long enough.
55. My concern is that the government doesn’t appear to care
about manufacturing.


56. None can destroy iron, but its rust can! Likewise, none can
destroy a person, but its mindset can!
57. Nothing works better than just improving your product.
58. One hundred years from now, I expect the Tatas to be much
bigger than it is now. More importantly, I hope the Group
comes to be regarded as being the best in India... best in the
manner in which we operate, best in the products we deliver
and best in our value systems and ethics.
59. One of the weaknesses of the Indian industry is that in
many areas... like consumer goods... it is very fragmented.
Individually, companies might not be able to survive.
60. Our challenge is to invest sufficiently in education.
61. People of great power wield great power, but people of
lesser power or people who have fallen out of power go to jail
without adequate evidence, or their bodies are found in the
trunks of cars.
62. People still believe what they read is necessarily the truth.
63. Power and wealth are not two of my main stakes.
64. Some foreign investors accuse us of being unfair to
shareholders by using our resources for community
development. Yes, this is money that could have made for
dividend payouts, but it also is money that’s uplifting and
improving the quality of life of people in the rural areas where
we operate and work. We owe them that.
65. Some people dream of success, while other people get up
every morning and make it happen.
66. Take the stones people to throw at you, and use them to
build a monument.
67. The country is now universally recognised as a nation on
the move and takes its place amongst the successful economies
in the region.
68. The day I am not able to fly will be a sad day for me.


69. The early Rockefellers made their wealth from being in
certain businesses and remained personally very wealthy.
Tata’s were different in the sense the future generations were
not so wealthy. They were involved in the business but most of
the family wealth was put into the trust and most of the family
did not enjoy enormous wealth.
70. The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with
people who are already the way you want to be.
71. The foreign investment adds a sense of competition; we
should see this as a wake-up call to modernise and upgrade.
72. The future potential is enormous but the country’s destiny
is in our hands.
73. The government should do its job. The government’s job is
to run the country, to manage the country, to govern the
country.
74. The Group’s investments in industries such as steel,
textiles, power and hotels were certainly driven by an
entrepreneurial spirit, but they were driven, even more, I
think, by a desire to make India self-sufficient and
independent of its colonial masters then.
75. The political system of the People’s Republic of China can
make things easy. Decisions are made quickly and results come
quickly, too. In our democracy (in India), on the other hand,
such things are extremely difficult.
76. The strong life and the weak die. There is some bloodshed,
and out of it emerges a much leaner industry, which tends to
survive.
77. The Telco is committed to commercial vehicles, where it is
bound to remain a major player. What may well happen in the
future is we may split the company into two business units.
78. The time has come for performance to be measured and for
allocated funds of the government to reach the people for whom
they were intended.
79. The time has come to move from small increments to bold,
large initiatives.


80. The time has come to stretch the envelope and set goals
which were earlier not seen to be possible.
81. The value of an idea lies in the using of it.
82. There are many things that, if I have to relive, maybe I will
do it another way. But I would not like to look back and think
about what I have not been able to.
83. There is no reason to now think that we can conquer the
world.
84. Ups and downs in life are very important to keep us going
because a straight line even in an ECG means we are not alive.
85. We can be a truly great nation if we set our sights high and
deliver to the people the fruits of continued growth, prosperity
and equal opportunity.
86. We have provinces, we have the rule of law, and we have a
system of justice. But those are also weaknesses when
compared with China. On the other hand, one of our strengths
is that we are very individualistic, and as individuals, we are
very creative. But that, too, is a weakness, because it keeps us
from working well together.
87. We like to say that India has the advantage of being a large
market.
88. We live in a highly competitive world and we Indians have
to struggle to catch up.
89. We need to build India into a land of equal opportunity for
all.
90. We need to stop taking baby steps and start thinking
globally. It seems to be helping.
91. We’re responsible for the fortunes of the company but this
is a bone-dry situation in terms of access to credit. Nobody can
operate on that basis unless you have large cash balances,
which we don’t.
92. What are the crumple zones on scooters? The helmet is the
only crumple zone I can think of.


93. What do you need to start a business? Three simple things:
know your product better than anyone, know your customer,
and have a burning desire to succeed.
94. What I have done is to establish growth mechanisms, play
down individuals and play up the team that has made the
companies what they are.
95. What I would like to do is to leave behind a sustainable
entity of a set of companies that operate in an exemplary
manner in terms of ethics, values and continue what our
ancestors left behind.
96. What is needed is a consortium of like companies in one
industry, presenting a strong front to the multinationals. The
Swiss watch industry did this.
97. When you find an idea that you just can’t stop thinking
about, that’s probably a good one to pursue.
98. When you see in places like Africa and parts of Asia abject
poverty, hungry children and malnutrition around you, and
you look at yourself as being people who have well being and
comforts, I think it takes a very insensitive, tough person not
to feel they need to do something.
99. Wonder what your customer wants? Ask. Don’t tell.
100. Young entrepreneurs will make a difference in the Indian
ecosystem.

## Success Principles of Ratan Tata

## W e all have heard a lot about the Tata Group. Ratan Tata

does not need any introduction due to his popularity in
industrial circles, for the group’s achievements and being the

most successful pioneers of India. He is famous in the start-up
circles for inspiring the youth through his life, philosophy and

especially the dynamism with which he overturned the failure
of many companies to churn a profit, making the conglomerate

hugely successful. The Group has had great wealth and
potential which has allowed it to grow by leaps and bounds in

its lifetime. Tata once said that ups and downs are essential in
one’s life because even a straight line in the ECG machine

conveys lifelessness. He reminds youth that, it is all the way
more important to rise in the long term while facing any short

terms ups and downs. In today’s time, it is hard to find an

industrialist who could show the youth a light like this which
instils the very idea that life is always uncertain for everyone.

As most of the individuals in the era of social media do believe
that all problems of the world are just an ongoing hashtag, and

all the rest are doing their best in their respective lives. This
unrealistic gap between virtual and real life is one of the

reasons for the rising depression rates in India.

He was born on December 28, 1937, in Surat, to Naval and
Sonoo Tata. Naval Tata was the adopted son of Jamsetji Ji and
Ratan Tata was raised by his paternal grandmother after his
parents’ separation. Although they remained in contact, Ratan
could never get the love, indulgence, support or the upbringing
from his own parents. He was very much close to his
grandmother, who looked after him and raised him. She was a
strict woman with a disciplined approach to life and tasks. He
does signify the ideal of disciplined approach in business due to
which JRD Tata had overlooked many seniors and appointed
Ratan Tata as the chairman of the Tata Group in 1991.


After having completed his studies in India, he went to the
US and applied at Cornell University, graduating in the field of
Architecture, securing a B.S. degree in Architecture and
Structural Engineering in 1962. He obtained an offer from
IBM, worked over for 15 days and returned to India when he
got to know about the adverse health of his grandmother, who
was the most important person in his life. During his stay in
the US, he was a living a life of any ordinary international
student. He worked at different levels of ‘so-called’ small and
big tasks to earn his money. He never wanted to return to
India and still admires the US and the right time that he spent
in the country. During his stay in India, JRD Tata got him
convinced to work for his family business. He applied at the
Harvard Business School and pursued an Advanced
Management Program in 1975.

The mission and motto of the Tata Group have always been
to develop India through industrialisation. When the English
East India Company’s rule ended, and the British Raj was
established after the First War of Independence in 1857, the
terms and conditions for Indian exporters were relatively more
liberal than during the reign of the company rule. Tata went
around the world to see the best industrial practices and
returned to India and invested in the same models and
programs. Jamsetji Tata began his business venture from a
textile unit and in over 150 years; the Group has grown into
more than 30 companies across ten business verticals,
including over 100 enterprises operating in over 100 countries
under the group name. This signifies that businesses are run
based on the ethos, attitude, and a rightful approach.

Tata Sons have great potential because of which we see a rise
of industrial glories. Yet, Tata is not counted as one of the
world’s richest person. The Group uses 66% of its profit in
philanthropy, and their business models are based on
providing quality services to consumers. One of the best perks
in the industrial sector is given over to their employees. This
was merit on which the Tata Group was founded, and Tata has
taken it forward in a huge way.


Mr. Tata once said, “Take the stones people throw at you and
use them to build a monument”. He proved his words right
himself. In 1999, after the failure of Tata Indica due to various
technical faults Mr. Tata decided to sell off the passenger
vehicle company in 1999. While he was at Detroit to finalise
the deal, then Head of Ford, Bill Ford and his team made
humiliating remarks against Ratan Tata’s idea and dream to
develop cars suitable for India. He flew home and decided to
heavily invest in Tata Motors to make it rise and shine. After
clearing out the technical faults in Tata Indica which was his
first indigenously developed Tata car for Indians. The company
launched the second generation of the vehicle called as Tata
Indica V2. It was a success this time. It was a viral experiment
to develop a diesel engine for a five-seater car. Later, almost
after nine years, the same Tata Motors took over JLR, i.e.
Jaguar Land Rover Company from Bill Ford. One may wonder
had Mr. Tata given up to Bill Ford then the course of history
would never have been this exciting.

He was appointed the director in-charge of NELCO which
stands for ‘National Radio and Electronics Company Limited’.
The main job of Mr. Tata was to help its struggling finances.
He actively worked towards attaining financial and production
line efficiency. The attempts were halted by Labour Union
strikes and the economic recession to overhaul the unit. It was
a big enterprise with just a 2% market share when Mr. Tata
joined. After having dedicated ten years of hard work, debts
were settled, and it turned into a profit-making unit. He had
understood and realised that any advancement in a company
could only be made with the introduction of the latest Science
and Technology. Soon NELCO acquired 20% market share in
the radio sector. Later the company manufactured inverters for
housing units. During his stint at NELCO, JRD Tata was
closely watching him. Being impressed with Mr. Tata’s
performance, the Board of Tata Group was confident about his
takeovers of all loss-making units, which did start churning
profit in a short period. It was in 1991 that JRD Tata got him
appointed as the new chairman of the Tata Group of
Companies. After his takeover, he turned most of the loss-


making enterprises into profit-making ones. He was thereby
succeeding in expanding the scope of financial viability and
feasibility of running multiple companies under the group. He
mainly transformed the managements, and brought in a vision
of division of labour for efficiency, and helped him do what he
had wanted.

In the 1980s, the then PM, Rajiv Gandhi’s mind-set was also
technical and believed in the necessity of scientific
temperament in terms of taking the country forward through
industrialisation premised on technological developments.
When he heard about Mr. Tata’s strategies, he assured of his
support to him. He made attempts to collaborate with Bill
Gates and IBM, and the nation saw the computer and
engineering sector getting a boost.

He got Tata Tea to acquire the teabag making company called
as Tetley. Tata Steel acquired Corus. He tried to consolidate
the same in the year 2000. In 2001, he launched the insurance
company called Tata AIG, in partnership with an American
Insurance Company. In 2003, TCS, i.e. Tata Consultancy
Services, became the first Indian software company cross the
threshold of earning more than 1 billion US Dollars in its
revenue kitty. He received the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and
Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the third and the second highest
civilian awards conferred by the Government of India
respectively. It was in 2008 that JLR was acquired in an all-
cash deal. He also favoured consolidation of companies by
using one Tata logo at all of its business units in operation. In
2006, he conceptualized the small car concept to favour a
qualitative change into the lives of Indians. Tata Nano did not
do well. However, he did everything to bring that concept into
life successfully. He is called as a philanthropist because the
Tata Trust spends 66% of his profits for CSR initiatives again
for the same mission to develop the country and bring a quality
change into lives of the ordinary people. They have always
donated generously during every natural disaster or a
calamity. The Group announced an INR 1500 Crore fund for
COVID-19 relief. These examples highlight the success of the


Tata Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Tata and the sheer
dynamism and persona held by Mr. Tata.

He was well aware that his success lies in the ethos that he
and his predecessors followed in life. Thus, he announced
infusion of 5 principles as a Code of Conduct under all
companies in The Group, i.e. Integrity, Understanding, Unity,
Responsibility and Excellence based on the premise of equality.
He believed that if he could get the employees to follow a
specific protocol/code, then not only the group would excel due
to the baseline underscoring the ideal of team spirit and
values-based work culture. He felt this would bring a better
and lasting change in the local level leadership of his company
and employees. Many factors have made Mr. Tata what he is
today; some of his Success Mantras are:

**1. Adjusting with life:** Mr. Tata though born and raised in a
good family, saw what no child should see, i.e. separation of his
parents. Yet he adjusted and adapted well growing up with his
grandparents. While he was in the US, he didn’t live a lavish
life. On his return to India, he understood the value of the
opportunity to take part in the family business, when JRD
Tata persuaded him not to return abroad, giving up his
ambitions in a way to continue his dream job at IBM. Later,
after having made NELCO a profit-making unit, all the loss-
making units were transferred to him. The world saw the best
of Mr. Tata when all the loss-making companies transferred to
him started performing well. He has proved that in the course
of life, there are many ups and downs. The need, however, is to
quickly adapt to those changes and make the best out of
oneself and the situation, to bring success and passion in the
pursuit of life.
**2. Ethos:** Mr. Tata was raised by his grandmother, and she
instilled a sense of discipline in him. JRD Tata saw this
efficacy in practice yielding good results. Thus, he was made
the chairman in 1991. If he were a man of casual attitude and
flexible values, then Tata Group would have been very
different today. For instance, when Bill Ford tried to insult Mr.
Tata, he was determined to take sweet revenge by proving to


the world that Tata Motors needed no mercy. This negative
episode of his life further strengthened him never to sell out
any Tata unit; for this, he ensured the best practices were
followed among the employees and the employers.

**3. Good Will and Perseverance:** Mr. Tata always took pride
in the legacy of his group. He never displayed any ego or
showed off what he has got. He is a lone guy with no family
and lives with two dogs, offers shelter to stray dogs in bad
weather. This is the goodwill that he carries with himself. In
every testing or challenging time in his life, he has never given
up, and the result is, under his tenure of chairmanship
revenues grew 40 fold and profit by 50 times. If one can learn
from him to never give up and keep following the integral path
of goodwill in personal and professional life, then its results
can be phenomenal.
**4. Caring for employees:** The Tata Group and Mr. Tata
especially, always understood that employees could make or
break the company. They offer their hard work, time and
energy because of which the Group operates. Thus, one reason
for his success is the fact that when it comes to offering perks
and welfare to employees, they follow the most excellent
practices. It is to the extent to keep high satisfaction and
happiness levels in them to ensure the best productivity ratios.
It fulfils the integral aspect of running the Tata Group, i.e.
broader humanitarian welfare through a qualitative change in
people’s life.
**5. Learning from the West:** Mr. Tata ensured to follow the
principle that worked the best for Tata Group, i.e. Learning
from the West. Mr. Tata was aware in the post-liberalization
era and rising privatization, the competition would come
through the channels of Globalisation. He ensured the best
science and technology was used to create synergies and
produce quality products. He heavily invested on the subject of
innovation and. It is this subject that has driven the change
under the era of Mr. Tata making him all the way more
successful, so much that today every Indian takes pride to
enjoy the luxury and comfort of a 5 star rated Global NCAP


cars, which is above and beyond all the safety parameters of
safety stipulated by the Government of India.
