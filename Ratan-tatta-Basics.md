### R

atan Naval Tata has stepped down as chair-
man of Tata Sons and while the entire team
at the $100 billion Tata conglomerate will
surely feel his absence, the average Indian too will
have reason to miss him. The country probably
never needed Tata more than it does today; as The
Economist wrote recently, ‘by standing out against
graft so publicly and consistently, Mr Tata was
ahead of his time’.
Not that the business suffered because of it; the
diversified conglomerate that he has headed for
more than two decades now has grown 20% annu-
ally since FY92 and at an even more impressive 30%
in the last six years to March, 2012, a feat that not
too many other business groups have been able to
match. With a bit of luck, it may have done better
but the fact remains that Tata chose to keep his dis-
tance from the political class and fortunately, for
him, there weren’t too many occasions on which he
needed to engage with it. On the few times that
there was a skirmish, he took tough decisions as
during the critical agitation over land in Singur
West Bengal when the plant was re-located to
Sanand in Gujarat. But more moving out, the Tatas
had offered to buy 400 acres and gift it to the affect-
ed farmers in return for the land Tata Motors had
used to set up its car plant. It was a fine gesture and
the kind of generosity that sets the Tatas apart from
the country’s other large industrial groups.
Tata’s biggest contribution to India though
would have to be the confidence that he instilled
in India’s engineers backed by his own conviction
that they could produce an indigenous car at an
affordable price and his determination to see the

```
projects — both the Indica and later the Nano —
succeed. As he himself said in interviews following
the launch, he was surprised at the interest that
the Nano — priced at just R1 lakh — evoked around
the world. That the Nano didn’t sell the kind of vol-
umes it was expected to must have been disap-
pointing for Tata. As must have been the debilitat-
ing losses in the telecom piece — an effort to
explore new areas in a liberalised economic
regime — or the ambitious $12-billion acquisition
of the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus which has
left Tata Steel hugely leveraged, an attempt at
making the group global.
No doubt the Tatas has the financial muscle to
foray into new spaces but there was also the
appetite for risk; some of the global buys may not
have been well-timed, a fact that Tata has gra-
ciously conceded. But there’s no doubt many of
the buys – the hotels for example – hold out
promise. The spectacular turnaround at the loss-
making Jaguar and Land Rover bought for $2.3 bil-
lion in March 2008 – critics carped that the Tatas
would never be able to sell luxury brands in unfa-
miliar markets – n less than three years was proof
of the group’s technological and marketing skills.
But it’s a fact that TCS accounts for a tenth of the
group’s turnover, a higher third of the profits and
half of the market capitalisation. However, scep-
tics who believed the Tatas would never do well in
the consumer space have been stumped by the
success of a Titan or even a Westside. The biggest
asset that Tata will leave for Cyrus Mistry, of
course, is a capable cadre of CEOs. But without its
‘ratan’ the Tata Group can never be the same.

## India’s Ratan

eBOOK


**By Morgen Witzel**

### W

hen Ratan Tata steps down as leader of
the Tata Group, it will be a landmark
moment in the group’s history. For
more than two decades, he has guided the group
through a period of unprecedented change, a peri-
od that has seen the Tata Group change from being
a highly respected Indian business into an organi-
sation that is increasingly engaged with the wider
world. In some ways, the change in the Tata Group
over the last 20 years reflects the changes in the
Indian economy.
Ratan Tata took over as leader from the much
respected and much loved JRD Tata at a very
important point. As Sumantra Ghoshal and Gita
Piramal pointed out in their book Managing Radi-
cal Change, Tata had to some extent become a
business group depending on its legacy. The Tata
name was respected and trusted, but was it
admired? As the Indian economy began its trans-
formation towards greater market orientation,
new names were beginning to emerge which
seemed to represent the future of Indian business.
Tata might have been consigned to its past.
Tata has changed all that. He did much to
strengthen the internal relationships and create
new harmony within the group, but that is in some
ways the least of his accomplishments. His real
legacy to the group has been twofold: The devel-
opment of an international strategy and the cre-
ation of the Tata brand.
‘Before 1990’, he once told me, ‘we had a reputa-
tion but we did not have a brand.’ The distinction is
an important one. Reputation is what other people
think about you; brand is the image of yourself
that you portray to other people. Tata knew that
managing that brand was essential not just to the

```
greater internal coordination and cohesiveness
that the group needed, but to reassert the values—
trust, innovation, commitment to community and
people—that had made Tata great in the first
place; values that had come dangerously close to
getting lost in the twilight years of JRD’s leader-
ship.
Establishing the brand meant not just changing
what Tata does, although there has been a historic
shift away from smokestack industries towards
services such as telecom and consultancy, which
are seen as being more in keeping with the needs
of modern India. It also meant telling the Tata sto-
ry in new ways, to new stakeholder groups. A
notable example has been Tata’s engagement with
the youth of India, and increasingly in other coun-
tries as well. As a result, Tata is now perceived by
young Indians as a thrusting, innovative, forward-
looking company; and this would not have been
the case 20 years ago.
The real alchemy here is that all of this has been
done without losing sight of fundamental Tata val-
ues. Indeed, they underpin the brand and are part
of its heart. When I talk about Tata to young Indian
students, they tell me that the very things they
admire about Tata are its values, its trustworthi-
ness and its belief in people. These are the very
ame values that Jamshetji N Tata laid down when
the group was founded. They are alive today and
they continue to help keep the Tata name strong.
The shift towards an international strategy
has been slower to develop. Not surprisingly,
the group proceeded cautiously down this
route at first. There was a lot to learn about
international markets customers and interna-
tional ways of doing business. TCS and, more
recently, Tata Motors, Tata Chemicals, Tata
Steel and Indian Hotels, have gone further
```

eBOOK

down the track towards internationalisation.
Tata’s view has always been, however, that Tata
could not remain a purely Indian business. Like
India itself, the group had to engage with the
outside world. That strategy is now starting to
pay dividends. The growth of Tata Motors and
Tata Steel, to take just two examples, has been
spectacular. And as their business portfolios
have begun to increase, so have their interna-
tional reputations.

```
Ratan has left the Tata Group a great legacy;
it is for others to act upon that legacy. Predict-
ing the future is always dangerous, but I will
make a prediction anyway. When the next his-
tories of the Tata Group are written in 20 or 30
years, the name of Ratan Tata will stand along-
side those of JN Tata and JRD Tata as one of the
great figures in the group’s history.

##### LIFE STORY

**BORN ON DECEMBER 28, 1937**
Ratan Naval Tata is the adoptive great grandson of
Tata Group founder Jamshetji Tata. His father
Naval Tata was adopted by Sir Ratan Tata from the
family of a distant relative. Ratan Naval Tata was
the eldest son of Naval Tata from his first marriage
to Soonoo Commisariat. Soonoo and Naval sepa-
rated when Ratan N Tata was seven years old.
Ratan and his brother were raised by grandmother
Lady Navajbai.
**BEGINS SCHOOLING IN BOMBAY —
1940S**
Ratan Tata began his schooling at South Bombay’s
Campion School. Followed by a stint at Bishop Cot-
ton in Shimla and finished off back in Bombay at
Cathedral and John Connon School.
**GOES TO THE US FOR HIGHER STUDIES
— LATE 1950S**
After finishing school, Ratan Tata went to Cornell
University in the US to study BS in architecture
with structural engineering. He graduated in 1962
and returned a few years later to the United States
to complete the Advanced Management Program
from Harvard Business School in 1975.
**JOINED FAMILY BUSINESS – 1962**


eBOOK

After completing his graduate degree in Cornell,
Tata worked briefly in Jones and Emmons, an
architecture firm in Los Angeles. In late 1962, Tata
returned home to join Tata Steel, on the advice of
then chairman of the group JRD Tata. Initially,
Ratan Tata worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel’s
Jamshedpur plant shovelling limestone and han-
dling the blast furnace.
**BEGAN MANAGERIAL CAREER AT
TATA GROUP — 1971**
Having served at various positions in different
group companies, Ratan Tata’s managerial career
at the Tata Group kicked off when he was appoint-
ed the director-in-charge of National Radio and
Electronics Company (NELCO) which sold radios
and televisions.
**TURBULENT TIMES — 1971-**
In an era of licence-permit raj, Ratan Tata strug-
gled to put the NELCO business back on track. Crit-
ics said he was out of depth. Barely 2% market
share and mounting losses slowed the turnaround
of the company. Just when Tata managed to put
things right at NELCO, Emergency was declared
and quickly NELCO was near collapse again. In
such a backdrop, Ratan Tata joined the board of
directors of Tata Sons Ltd in 1974.
**FRESH START, BUT STRUGGLES CON-
TINUE — 1974-**
Ratan Tata’s next assignment at the group was not
any easier than NELCO. He took charge of Empress
Mills at 1977.
Having been refused a R50 lakh investment to
turn around the textile mill followed by Mumbai’s
textile mill workers’ strike, Empire Mills floun-
dered and finally closed in 1986.
**FIRST SIGNS OF A FUTURE LEADER —
1981-**
Amidst criticism from several quarters, JRD Tata
stepped down as chairman of Tata Industries, the
group’s second promoter holding company and
handed over the reins to Ratan Tata in 1981. Imme-
diately, Ratan Tata got down to work and drew up
a group strategic plan in 1983 which emphasised
on venturing into high-technology businesses,

```
focussing on select markets and products, judi-
cious mergers and acquisitions and leveraging
group synergies. Ratan Tata also promoted seven
high-tech businesses under Tata Industries in the
eighties — Tata Telecom, Tata Finance, Tata Kel-
tron, Hitech Drilling Services, Tata Honeywell, Tata
Elxsi and Plantek. But successes also came with
challenges. Most of Tata Group companies were
headed by strong and independent CEOs and
Ratan Tata’s ideas were left in the back room. Bad
luck continued as well. In 1988, Ratan Tata took
charge of TELCO in the middle of one of the worst
labour disputes in Tata history. However, this,
unlike other challenges was something where
Ratan Tata felt he could bring a change rather than
just fire fight.
TAKES OVER THE REINS — 1991
With a host of other contenders for the spot of Tata
Sons Ltd chairman and an unconvincing career yet
at the group, Ratan Tata took over from JRD Tata in
```
1991. Detractors included big names in the Tata
Group like Russi Mody at Tata Steel, Darbari Seth at
Tata Chemicals, Ajit Kerkar at Indian Hotels and
others. However, JRD told Tata Group historian RM
Lala that the decision to choose Ratan Tata was tak-
en because JRD felt Ratan would be more like him.
**INITIAL YEARS AT THE HELM — 1991-
2000**
The first few years at the top for Ratan Tata were
marked by fire-fighting the group’s satraps.
Backed by his loyalists like R K Krishna Kumar, a
fellow director of Tata Sons, the group slowly
began to focus on new generation businesses like
telecom, software, retail and cars while selling off
unrelated businesses of cosmetics, soaps and
cement. Tata also focused on the Tata brand itself
and in 1998 the group companies had a single
group logo and the Tata brand belonged to the
holding company Tata Sons Ltd.
**THE HOUSE OF TATA GOES GLOBAL —
2000-**
When Ratan Tata took over in 1991, less than 5% of
the group’s R14,000 crore revenue came from
overseas. When he retires on his 75th birthday,


eBOOK

nearly half of the group’s R5,54,00 crore ($100.
billion) revenue comes from overseas. Tata knew
from the beginning that the group will need global
technologies to stay competitive in a post-liber-
alised India. The global acquisition spree began
with Tata Tea’s acquisition of Tetley group in the
UK for $430 million. While Indian Hotels bought
hotels in the US and group companies kept making
successful strategic acquisitions abroad the block-
busters were yet to come. In 2007, Tata Steel

```
bought Corus Plc for $12.1 billion to be catapulted
to the top ten list of global steel makers. The fol-
lowing year, Tata Motors became the owner of
Jaguar Land Rover for $2.3 billion. While the two
businesses have gone in opposite directions — JLR
turned profitable while Corus became a drag on
the books — the acquisition of the two major glob-
al brands well and truly put the house of Tata on
the global map. A legacy which Ratan Tata leaves
behind for Cyrus P Mistry.

**MR RNT’S** character and strength of purpose can
be judged from his own words:
“If you hold a gun to my head, you have two
choices, you either move the gun away or pull the
trigger, because I will not move my head.”
A look at his actions will prove that in a vast
majority of cases, the gun was pulled away,
because he has stood firm on his convictions.

```
Now Mr RNT lays down the reins of the Tata
empire exactly on the date he had set for himself
more than a decade ago, on his turning 75. Not for
him the argument that he is “irreplaceable” (in
many ways he is), and to make sure that he is not
looked upon as the “Ghost Upstairs” in Bombay
House, he is physically moving out. It is his way to
ensure that Cyrus, his successor, does not have to
```

eBOOK

live under his shadow.
I well remember RNT’s desire, conveyed to us
two decades ago, that we should always carry two
names in our pocket. One, of “a person who can
take over if you are knocked down by a bus later in
the day”, and the other of “a person who would be
groomed to take over from you 3-5 years down the
road”.
He is retiring at the peak of his achievements;
but I am sure he is proud of the fact that his group
has achieved a turnover of over $100 billion, Tata
now has a footprint across the globe and has made
several big-ticket global acquisitions.
But most of all it is a coherent, well-knit group
of companies bound by the ideals of Tata House –
integrity, trust and the desire to give back to the
community.
He has made ‘Tata’ into a globally recognised
brand. I recall a visit to Europe in the early 1990s
where five senior Tata Group executives were pre-
sent. Wherever we went, we presented five differ-
ently-designed calling cards. He was disturbed by
the lack of uniformity in the group; a branding
exercise was put into motion. Within a year, the
new Tata logo was born. In fact, with the benefit of
hindsight, we did not need an external agency, as
most of the design work was done by RNT himself!
All Tata companies have now proudly adopted that
logo.
It was not always so. In the early days after JRD
anointed him as his successor, he had a difficult
time. Even before that, in the 1970s, RNT had
tough nuts to crack, the Empress and other textile
mills and NELCO to name but two. But those
assignments also gave him the experience on what
to “keep and nurture” and what to “drop” in the

```
years ahead.
Also JRD had left behind a ‘federation’ of indi-
vidual satraps who guarded their fiefdoms and
were not disposed to help each other. A ‘group’
concept was not popular. Also JRD ran the compa-
nies on the strength of his personal charisma. The
right to manage through ownership was not possi-
ble when the public sector was supreme, and in
many companies, the Tata shareholding was mini-
mal. RNT recognised that the ‘right to manage’
came from ownership, and from the start, Tatas
have raised their holdings in companies.
RNT also encouraged ‘across the group’ activi-
ties, which brought a feeling of ‘togetherness’ and
encouraged executives to move from one Tata
company to another. Group executives now come
together on common theme programmes and
build on their experiences.
RNT’s style is not to ‘thump the table’, but to
‘softly mandate’ on what he feels should be the
path to follow – and others do follow.
He is a workaholic, and stands by his commit-
ments even under physical pain. He once travelled
from Mumbai to Europe, flat on his back and under
medication (and against medical advice) to keep a
commitment for a motor show.
Just like JRD’s first love was aviation, Ratan’s
first love is automobiles. This, I guess makes Tata
Motors his first charge. I had always hoped that
Tata Steel (where he did a stint in the 1960s) could
be his second love!
As he rides out of Bombay House, he will simul-
taneously ride into Tata trusts, where he will
devote himself to the philantrophic activities of
the Tatas. Let us wish him a successful and long
stint in his chosen field.

eBOOK

**RATAN TATA** is too great a person for me to com-
ment on. However, I have a lot of personal regard
for Tata, a man who has given his life to the organi-
sation. Armed with humility and empathy, Tata is
always willing to look at problems. From the
moment you tell him your problem, it becomes his
own. I have not worked with him much, since by
the time he became TCS boss, I had retired. But I
had contact with him when I was looking after
Tata Elxsi.
People don’t realise that Tata went through the
grind before he took over. It is sometimes easy to
think that if you are a member of the family, you
don’t have to go through the grind. When I joined,
JRD Tata and Ratan Tata’s father, Naval Tata, were
there. Ratan Tata was an architect. He did his edu-
cation in architecture in Cornell University. I think
his first job was with Tisco in Jamshedpur.
TCS started in 1969. In the initial days, apart
from licence raj, the government was dead against
computers. This was a socialist/communist view.
The same is true about today’s clamour over FDI in
multibrand retail.

```
Tata understands all the dimensions of the busi-
ness and his biggest contribution was in turning
around Jaguar and Land Rover. That makes me
think of Air India, of which JRD was the first chair-
man.
JRD and Ratan Tata were two people with differ-
ent styles. But were always willing to experiment.
Let’s not forget TCS came in JRD’s time. I was shift-
ed from Tata Power. PM Agarwala, who was my
boss, died after a stroke, so I got stuck. Tata took it
forward with Tata Communications and Tata Elxsi.
It was necessary for them to give a free hand to
their executives who ran companies. They did
what a parent would do. The parent doesn’t inter-
fere with the child, but if the child has a problem,
he comes and helps. That’s a very different rela-
tionship. They were not the ring masters.
I should say that JRD and Ratan Tata were sensi-
tive to the companies they set up. Those were the
days when you set up a computer company, but
you couldn’t import a computer. But their com-
mitment to the country is total. You don’t run
away from the country.

eBOOK

**RATAN TATA** is leaving a legacy which is compara-
ble to that left behind by some of his predecessors.
That is precisely what is expected of him, and he
can hang up his boots, satisfied with his perfor-
mance. It is not always that we find corporate
leaders like Tata who have weathered storms
while continuing to contribute immensely to the
challenges of institution-building over two
decades. They become legends. Tata has trans-
formed a relatively smaller group that he had
inherited, quietly but with determination into a
much larger and respectable empire in the world.
He took charge of a family-controlled but pro-
fessionally-managed group under difficult cir-
cumstances. In fact, he was not groomed to step
into the larger-than-life size shoes of his predeces-
sor JRD Tata. The process of building a legacy
began then. He had the challenge of evolving a
new growth vision while fighting disruptive
forces. In fact, his success at consolidating his posi-
tion organisationally must be viewed as the cradle
where he learnt the art of building an empire.
The circumstances under which Tata took
charge of the reins of the group were hostile.
While he inherited the empire, the kingdoms were
under the control of rebellious kings who not did
not approve of him but, in fact, went to the extent

```
of trying to dethrone him. This is where his faith in
trusteeship and determination to win the cause
comes out clearly. As a trustee of the wealth of the
Tatas, he had to take charge and lead from the
front. He did that successfully, and made the insti-
tution stronger.
A leader’s ability to inspire comes not only from
the techno-managerial capabilities that he
exhibits, but also the sincerity with which he
undertakes the challenges and leads. Tata has
proven time and again that he believes in the fun-
damental strengths of the Tata Group. The group
has always believed in values such as compassion
for all stakeholders. He continued to practice the
values of the organisation that he was destined to
lead. Even at the time of finding a successor, he did
not go ahead and announce a hand-picked succes-
sor. He wanted to ensure that the person who was
stepping into the chair that he was going to vacate
had the capabilities to take the organisation to
newer heights. The future had to be in safe hands.
He continued to adhere to the human values
such as caring and collaboration across the group.
Employees were often paid salary increments
even when the concerned group company made
financial losses. The logic being: The factory work-
ers did not do anything wrong for the less than

adequate performance of the organisation. This
was especially so at the worker level. The group
did not start cutting staff even in the newly-
acquired Corus in UK.
The beginning of economic liberalisation in
1991 coincided with the arrival of Tata as the
future leader of the group. That was the water
shed, make or break moment for India. The coun-
try badly needed entrepreneurial organisations
to emerge out of existing groups to steer the
growth graph. Given that a substantial majority
of Indian businesses are family controlled and
managed, the onus was on leaders like Tata to
become entrepreneurial in terms of thinking and
action. His passion for technology, innovation
and enthusiasm to prove to the world the inher-
ent potential of the country to be a manufactur-
ing destination was proven with the design,
development and manufacture of the cheapest
but technologically-advanced car of the century,
the Nano. While there may be a number of rea-
sons for the less than expected market perfor-
mance of Nano, it gave thumbs-up to India’s
capabilities beyond IT.
Even in IT, the growth of TCS is a demonstration
of his ability to trust and delegate operations and

```
strategy to capable executives. He allowed his
team to be entrepreneurial. The group’s growth
beyond its traditional boundaries is an evidence of
the capabilities of the team that Tata built over a
period. The group believed in what is now called
portfolio entrepreneurship and grew exponential-
ly.
The group has grown multifold over the past
two decades, and has become force to reckon with
globally. This is precisely what all long-lasting
family-controlled businesses have done across the
world in their pursuit to build and perpetuate suc-
cessfully.
Tata will only be retiring from his responsibili-
ties as the executive head of the group. He will
continue to be active in several other capacities,
including that of leading some of the large Tata
trusts. As chairman of some of them, he will con-
tinue to influence the vision and strategies of the
group. He is only redefining his role and is passing
over the baton of leadership to a younger person in
whom he and the group have faith. It is obvious
that a person of his commitment and capability
will only be delighted to see the institution that he
has nurtured for two decades continues to grow.
That alone will make eternal his legacy.

### T

he days when Mumbai's Parsi community
dominated a city they helped to build may
have faded, but the rise of Cyrus Mistry to
the helm of the Tata Group reinforces the clout it
wields in some of India's biggest conglomerates.
Mistry's selection as chairman-designate of
India's biggest corporate house keeps the group
close to the founding Tata family as he is a mem-
ber through the marriage of his sister. The choice
also keeps the business in the hands of the close-
knit community which is as old as the city itself.
From shipyards to textile firms, Mumbai's Par-
sis, descendants of Persians who first landed in
India in the ninth century, led the city's commer-
cial development from sleepy fishing islands to
one of Asia's business capitals.
Big business houses led by the Tata, Godrej and
Wadia families keep that tradition alive today.
"Tata is a Parsi business, and so it is important
that someone who grasps the culture of the
group is at the top," said Zubin Karkaria, a Parsi
and chief executive officer and managing direc-
tor of international visa administration firm VFS
Global.
Bombay House, the brick colonial building in
the heart of south Mumbai where Mistry, 43, will

```
take the reins of the $83 billion Tata empire next
December, is the seat of power for a community
Parsis say is inseparable from the city's history.
Mistry is the youngest son of construction
magnate Pallonji Mistry, known as "the world's
richest Parsi" with estimated wealth of $8.8 bil-
lion, according to Forbes.
Octogenarian Pallonji and the 73-year-old
Ratan Tata are stalwarts of business groups that
date back more than 140 years, carrying on a
legacy of more than 300 years of Parsi-led indus-
trial development in India's commercial capital.
Other Parsi industrialits such as Adi Godrej,
head of the consumer goods and real estate-
focused Godrej Group, and textile and property
baron Nusli Wadia, ensure their business influ-
ence far outstrips their dwindling numbers.
"Parsis really were the pioneers of the Indian
industrial movement and have put a lot into the
industrial development of the country," said
Shernaaz Engineer, editor of Jam-e-Jamshed, the
179-year-old Parsi newspaper.
Nariman Point, which is losing its stature as
the city's prime business district, is named after
the Parsi who built it, while many of Mumbai's
hospitals and colleges bear the names of Parsi
merchants who forged the city's development as
a trade hub in the 19th century.

### T

he Parsis settled in Mumbai in the 1640s
when the city was under Portuguese con-
trol, according to the Bombay Parsi Pun-
chayet (BPP), a 330-year-old administrative body.
By the mid 19th-century, Parsi industrialists
had launched trading, printing and engineering
businesses and in 1854, founded the city's first
commercial bank.
"They have really put a lot into the city," said
Engineer. "Mumbai and the Parsis are absolutely
interlinked."
Surnames like Engineer, or Contractor and their
job-specific Indian equivalents are common
among the Parsi community.
Today, BPP administers over 4,000 Parsi-only
apartments across the city open only to vetted
applicants, runs a Parsi-only blood bank and
awards scholarships and other financial support to
students from the community.

At the request of the union, I spent my last day
prior to retirement in the Tata Motors’s various
manufacturing facilities at Pune to say farewell
to my shop-floor colleagues. We have been
together in good times and bad and have
gained a closeness based on mutual trust.
```
```
Going through the plants and receiving
greetings from so many colleagues is a great
emotional experience. I have been deeply
moved by the sincerity and the spontaneity of
their greetings.

I will always carry memories of

this day with me through the

rest of my life
